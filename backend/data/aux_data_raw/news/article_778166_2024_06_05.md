Alta Signa Europe B.V., the European boutique managing general agent (MGA) and Lloyd’s coverholder, announced the opening of an office in Switzerland, marking a significant milestone in the company’s expansion strategy in the Germany, Austria and Switzerland (DACH) region.
Based in Cham, Zug, the Swiss office will initially focus on directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance, with plans to extend its offerings to financial institutions, cyber, and international marine business.
This strategic move enhances Alta Signa’s ability to serve the diverse and sophisticated Swiss market, known for its strong financial services sector, luxury goods industry, and commodity trading, the company said.
“With our existing offices in Germany and Austria, the new branch in Switzerland represents the final milestone in our DACH regional footprint,” commented Maximillian Moll, branch manager – DACH.
“Establishing an office here allows us to leverage our local language skills and distribution networks, which are core to Alta Signa’s unique position in the market,” Moll added. “This presence will enable us to offer enhanced insurance solutions developed by technical experts and tailored to the specific needs of the Swiss market, where we see strong growth potential.”
“We believe the Swiss financial services and cyber insurance markets will continue to expand, and offer tremendous opportunities for those that are able to match specialist underwriting expertise and local market insights with global risk capacity, particularly for constantly evolving or newly emerging specialty risks,” according to Gerard Van Loon, chief executive officer of Alta Signa.
Alta Signa is headquartered in Brussels and now operates regional service hubs in France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
