Juniper Re LLC, the specialist reinsurance broking arm of The Baldwin Group, announced its entry into the London market, appointing industry veteran Nick Hawke as head of office.
With more than four decades of reinsurance experience in the London market, Hawke is leading Juniper Re’s strategic expansion into London’s global reinsurance hub, the company said, noting that the move strengthens its ability to serve clients with greater capacity, access to world-class talent, and a wealth of market insight.
Hawke has held senior leadership roles at Guy Carpenter and Willis Re (now Gallagher Re), where he specialized in property treaty placements and led high-performing teams.
Throughout his career, Hawke has been instrumental in designing innovative reinsurance solutions and delivering complex placements for a diverse range of clients. His deep-rooted understanding of market dynamics and relationships will enable Juniper Re to establish itself quickly and soundly in the London marketplace, the broker continued.
Since its founding in August 2023, Tampa, Florida-based Juniper Re has made several other strategic moves, including its entry into Bermuda with the appointment of Chris Hayward as well as the recent hirings of Russ Wagner, Nick Pewter, and Becky Lucking, which coincided with expansions into the facultative, parametric, and Bermuda wholesale spaces, respectively.
Juniper Re’s parent firm, The Baldwin Group, the brand name for The Baldwin Insurance Group Inc., is an independent insurance distribution firm that provides risk management, insurance, and employee benefits’ solutions.
