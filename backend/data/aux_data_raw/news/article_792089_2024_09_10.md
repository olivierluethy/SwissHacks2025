Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange (PURE) is for the first time going international with an expansion into Canada.
The reciprocal exchange will start serving high net worth clients in Ontario with homeowners insurance through select brokers. Future products include automobile coverage in Ontario, with planned expansion to other provinces in the future, PURE said.
“PURE is new to Canada, but we’ve been serving high net worth members in the U.S. for almost 20 years,” said Martin Leitch, CEO. “With this expansion, we are able to offer coverage solutions to existing Canadian PURE members who have trusted us to protect their U.S. interests and to reach new members who have not yet experienced what it means to be a PURE member.”
Currently, PURE is one of the top insurers in the high net worth space in the U.S., offering coverage in all 50 states for high value homes, automobiles, collections, watercrafts, personal excess liability, fraud, cyber and flood to more than 100,000 policyholders, or members.
Members get broader coverage than often found in the homeowners market, as well as a thorough home risk assessment, PURE said.
