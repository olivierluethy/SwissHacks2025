AXA Insurance announced it has rebranded its Chinese reinsurance unit, XL Re China, to AXA International Re.
The name change took effect on Oct. 16, 2024, following approval from the Chinese regulator, the National Financial Regulatory Administration
The move follows AXA’s April acquisition of all of the shares of XL Re China. The plan for the name change was announced at that time.
“As a global leading insurer, we are actively refining our business development strategy to strengthen our presence in mainland China,” said Sally Wan, chief executive officer, AXA Greater China, noting that AXA entered the Chinese insurance market in the 1990s.
“This strategic renaming to ‘AXA International Re’ underscores our commitment to the mainland Chinese market, where we aim to provide innovative and effective reinsurance solutions and leverage our global experience for risk diversification while fostering synergy with the AXA’s brand,” she added.
AXA Insurance, which is formally known as AXA China Region Insurance Co. (Bermuda) Ltd., is part of AXA Hong Kong and Macau, which is a member of AXA Group.
