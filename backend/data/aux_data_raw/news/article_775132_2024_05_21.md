CFC, the London-based specialist managing general agent, announced the appointment of Kate Della Mora to the newly created role of CEO, CFC Canada.
Della Mora’s appointment coincides with the launch of CFC’s first office on the ground in Canada, based in Toronto, with the ambition of building a team of business development professionals to provide Canadian brokers across the country with direct access to support, complementing CFC’s existing Canada-facing underwriting teams based in the UK.
Della Mora joins CFC from Marsh Canada where she held the role of National Specialty Growth leader for over four years and has extensive experience of cyber and professional liability from her years at Allianz, Liberty International, Berkley and Travelers.
“This hire marks another exciting step for CFC as we expand our global footprint and aim to be closer to our broker partners,” commented Louise O’Shea, group CEO, CFC.
CFC said it has offered insurance solutions to Canadian brokers for more than two decades. During that time it has grown to become a market leader in cyber and now offers over 20 classes of specialist insurance to protect businesses in nearly every industry with products designed for emerging and technology based risks, the company said.
Headquartered in London with offices in New York, San Francisco, Austin, Toronto, Brussels, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane, CFC has more than 900 employees, who work with more than 150,000 businesses in 90 countries
