Volkswagen AG has lost hope that many of its roughly 4,000 vehicles aboard a cargo ship that caught fire last week in the Atlantic can be saved.
The automaker’s brands and dealers have started notifying customers that the U.S.-bound vehicles will likely not be delivered, a spokesperson said Friday. “Individual solutions” are being worked out with customers, Volkswagen said.
