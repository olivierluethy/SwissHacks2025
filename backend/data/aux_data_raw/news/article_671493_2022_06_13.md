Insurance broker WTW has enhanced the capability of its Climate Diagnostic tool, which was first launched in April 2021. In response to an increase in Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting and the ever-growing need for transparency, WTW clients will now have the ability to generate tailored, instantaneous, and in-depth TCFD reports using their own collected data.
This next iteration of the Climate Diagnostic tool is in line with the latest regulatory guidance and addresses the growing call for a consistent framework and set of standards for climate-related reporting alongside comparable metrics.
“Climate change has wrought progressively more tangible and globally devastating consequences. As companies seek to better understand their climate exposure and develop risk management strategies, WTW has developed a comprehensive visual representation of a businesses’ risk, powered by the client’s own data and analytics,” commented Andy Smyth, head of GB risk and analytics, WTW, in a statement.
WTW is providing clients “with an essential integrated tool as they look to bolster their climate resilience,” he added.
