The heavy rains and severe floods of Storm Boris, which inundated Central and Eastern Europe during the second week in September, will be the most severe flood event in about a decade, carrying an insurance price tag of an estimated €2.2 billion ($2.5 billion), according to S&P Global Ratings in a report.
While insurers’ property/casualty performance will be affected, the companies rated by S&P “have sound reinsurance protection, posted strong half year results in 2024, have diversified earnings streams, and sound capital adequacy, all of which should serve to protect credit quality,” said the ratings agency in a report titled “Central European Insurers’ Financial Strength Is A Barrage Against Flood Damage.”
S&P noted that its estimates of insured losses of €2.2 billion (US$2.5 billion) across Czechia [the Czech Republic], Poland, Austria, and Romania are at the lower end of the €2 billion-€3 billion (US$2.2 billion-US$3.3 billion) range indicated by reinsurance broker Gallagher Re.

On the other hand, Guy Carpenter estimated a market loss between €1.6 billion and €2.1 billion (US$1.8 billion-US$2.3 billion) in its report on the floods published on Sept. 24.
Guy Carpenter said the region’s flood impact demonstrates its progress in preparedness as rainfall exceeded a 100-year return period, but resulted in 25-65 year losses for insurers in Czech Republic, Poland and Austria.
