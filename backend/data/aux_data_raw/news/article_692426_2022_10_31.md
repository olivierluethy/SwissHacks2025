The Philippines said 98 people died from flooding and landslides triggered by storm Nalgae, which hit the country over the weekend.
The death toll has risen from 48 reported Sunday, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said on Monday. There were 69 people injured and 63 others missing, it said.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rejected a proposal from the disaster-management agency to declare a national state of calamity for one year. “I don’t think it’s necessary,” he said in a televised briefing, adding that the damage is confined to areas hit by the storm. The measure would have triggered a nationwide release of emergency funds and a price freeze throughout the country.
Based on government’s initial estimates, the damage to agriculture is about 435 million pesos ($7.5 million) while infrastructure losses amount to about 758 million pesos. A state of calamity is in effect in 158 towns or cities comprising four regions including Bicol and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
The storm, locally called Paeng, affected about 590,000 families as it slammed areas across the three major island groups of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Nalgae is forecast to leave the Philippines this afternoon or evening, the state weather bureau said in its latest report Monday.
