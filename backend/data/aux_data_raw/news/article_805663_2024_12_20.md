Liberty Mutual Holding Co. is considering a sale of its businesses in Thailand and Vietnam as the US insurer seeks to streamline its operations, according to people familiar with the matter.
Liberty Mutual is working with a financial adviser on the potential disposal, which could help it raise a few hundred million dollars, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Other global and regional insurers have expressed preliminary interest in the assets, the people said.
Considerations are ongoing and no final decisions have been made, the people said. A representative for Liberty Mutual declined to comment.
A move to sell Thailand and Vietnam would follow other previous disposals from Liberty Mutual globally. Earlier this year, the US insurer sold a group of European businesses to Assicurazioni Generali SpA for around $2.5 billion as part of its efforts to exit non-core markets and bulk up in US property and casualty insurance.
