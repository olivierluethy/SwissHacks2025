Global commercial insurance rates remained flat during the second quarter of 2024 (down from a 1% increase in Q1 2024), according to Marsh’s Global Insurance Market Index.
The findings mark the first time in nearly seven years – since the third quarter of 2017 – that the global composite rate has not increased, Marsh said, noting that the continued moderation of rates was largely driven by increasing competition among insurers in the global property market.
On average, Q2 rates decreased by 5% in Canada and the Pacific, and by 3% in the UK and in Asia regions. Rates increased in the US and Europe by 1%, and by 4% in the Latin America and the Caribbean and India, Middle East, and Africa (IMEA) regions.
Other findings in the report included:
“We have seen the continued moderation of the global composite rate over the past few years, with a stable composite in Q2 2024, which is a positive movement for our clients,” commented Pat Donnelly, president, Marsh Specialty and Global Placement, in a statement.
All references to rate and rate movements in this report are averages, unless otherwise noted. For ease of reporting, Marsh has rounded all percentages regarding rate movements to the nearest whole number. Insurance broker Marsh is a subsidiary of Marsh McLennan.
