Everest Group Ltd., the Bermuda-based property/casualty and specialty re/insurer, announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Jim Williamson as president and chief executive officer, effective immediately.
Williamson was most recently Everest’s acting CEO, a position he assumed when Juan Andrade left the company to become president and CEO of USAA in early January. Prior to that, he served as the company’s EVP and group COO, and head of the Reinsurance and Insurance Divisions. He has held roles of increasing seniority since joining Everest as group COO in 2020.
His career in the industry, with senior positions at The Hartford, Chubb and ACE, spans over two decades, and covers all aspects of the P/C industry, including commercial, specialty and consumer business lines in the US and overseas.
“Over the past four years, Jim has consistently demonstrated sound judgement and value creation at Everest, earning the respect of his colleagues and the Board,” said Chairman of the Board Joseph Taranto. “Jim’s extensive industry experience, deep knowledge of the Company and outstanding performance make him the right person to lead the next chapter for Everest.”
