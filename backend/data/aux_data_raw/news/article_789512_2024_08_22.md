Yellow weather warnings are in place for Scotland on Thursday, as the remnants of Hurricane Ernesto bring strong winds and heavy rain.
There‚Äôs an alert for rain across western Scotland, with more than 100 millimeters (4 inches) forecast for higher ground, according to the UK Met Office. At the same time, a wind warning covers parts of northern Wales, northern England and southern Scotland, with gusts of up to 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour expected.
‚ÄúOur global forecast model shows that Ernesto remnants have phased in with the jet stream, becoming part of a large scale extra-tropical storm system,‚Äù which could also impact Norway, according to Climavision.
Hurricane Ernesto brought dangerous winds and drenching rains to Bermuda last week, flooding low-lying areas of the British territory. The conditions on Thursday have the potential to disrupt transport across northern parts of the UK, including rail and ferry services.
High wind generation saw UK day-ahead prices for delivery on Thursday fall to their lowest since Aug 8.
