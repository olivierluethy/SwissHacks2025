Antares announced that Antares Global Management (Bermuda) Ltd. (AGML Bermuda) has received approval from Lloyd’s to operate as a Lloyd’s in-house coverholder.
This will enable AGML Bermuda to write Lloyd’s business on behalf of Antares Syndicate 1274 from Bermuda, in addition to the managing agent’s operations in Singapore, Antares Underwriting Asia Pte Ltd.
“I am delighted to announce that Antares has been granted this approval by Lloyd’s, which effectively enables us to make all our Lloyd’s product lines much more accessible to brokers. This is one of several initiatives underway to strengthen the business as it continues to expand to meet our ambitious growth targets,” commented Michael van der Straaten, CEO, Antares.
