The Fortegra Group Inc., the Jacksonville, Florida-based specialty insurer and subsidiary of Tiptree Inc., announced it has received regulatory approval to launch a UK subsidiary, called Fortegra Insurance Company UK.
The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) granted Fortegra UK the license, effective Nov. 29, 2024.
This milestone enables Fortegra to significantly expand its specialty insurance underwriting services throughout the United Kingdom, the company said, noting that the licensing of Fortegra UK provides an excellent opportunity to enhance the company’s presence in the UK and London markets.
This strategic initiative builds on previous successes in Belgium and the EU, Fortegra added.
“We’re pleased to announce the establishment of Fortegra Insurance Company UK,” said Richard Kahlbaugh, Fortegra’s chief executive officer, in a statement. “Our objective is simple. We focus our efforts on establishing Fortegra as a quality market serving MGAs and agents seeking to underwrite niche programmes. The foundation of our past success, underwriting discipline, will serve Fortegra well as we enter the marketplace in the United Kingdom.”
Fortegra expanded its global operations to the UK in 2017, domiciled Fortegra Europe Insurance Co. Ltd. (FEICL) in Malta in March 2018. FEICL announced the registration of a branch office in Prague, Czech Republic, in September 2021.
