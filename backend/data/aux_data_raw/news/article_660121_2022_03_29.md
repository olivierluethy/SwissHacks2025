Denmark’s Orsted said on Monday it had agreed to sell half of the Hornsea 2 project in Britain, which will become the world’s biggest offshore wind farm, to a French consortium for 3 billion pounds ($3.94 billion).
The deal is consistent with the Danish energy giant’s strategy of selling off large stakes in operational wind parks to invest the capital in new projects.
