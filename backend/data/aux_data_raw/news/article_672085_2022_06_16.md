Servca, the independent Lloyd’s broker that specializes in non-standard medical, financial and professional lines insurance, announced the opening of an office in Malta to spearhead the expansion of its European business.
With passporting rights to all 28 EU countries, complete with Lloyd’s Brussels access, Servca is able to cover all lines of casualty insurance within Europe, supported by strong partner brokers.
“The future opportunities to expand and grow our business in Europe from a base in Malta are very exciting,” commented Nomaan (Noah) Jamal, chief executive officer of Servca Group.
“The island has a high concentration of domiciled European corporates as a result of an attractive tax regime and business-friendly eco-system with a particular focus on emerging risks such as technology, financial institutions, e-gaming/sports and medical technology which complements our areas of specialist knowledge,” Jamal added.
“The region is largely under-served for a client-centric specialty wholesale broker to deliver bespoke insurance solutions to retail brokers in the Mediterranean,” he said.
“We look forward to increasing our market share in post-‘Brexit’ Europe and realigning with our European broker-clients.”
Servca’s Malta office is led by Andrew Magri, business development manager, and Ian Zammit, executive director, both of whom will report to Noah Jamal and Dr. Edwin Rajadurai as managing director.
