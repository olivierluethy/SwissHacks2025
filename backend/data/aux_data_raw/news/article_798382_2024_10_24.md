Global commercial insurance rates fell 1% in the third quarter of 2024 from the previous quarter, which marked the first time the index has recorded a quarterly decline since the third quarter of 2017, according to the Global Insurance Market Index published by insurance broker Marsh.
The result is a continuation of the moderating rate trend, which is largely being driven by increased competition among insurers in the global property market, Marsh said.
The UK and the Pacific regions experienced the largest composite rate decreases, at 5% and 6%, respectively, while the US and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region experienced the highest composite rate increases, both at 3%. On the other hand, rates were flat in Europe.

Other findings included:
“In the third quarter, for the first time in seven years, we saw a decline in the global composite rate, with three of the four major product lines experiencing a decrease, which is a positive development for our clients,” commented Pat Donnelly, president, Marsh Specialty and Global Placement, Marsh.
“We are watching the markets closely for any impacts from the recent devastating storms during the North American hurricane season, and continue to offer support to our clients and the broader communities affected by them.”
