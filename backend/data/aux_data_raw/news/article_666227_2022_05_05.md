Fidelis Insurance Holdings Ltd. and its wholly owned UK subsidiaries have moved to new offices in London on the 42nd Floor of 22 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4BQ.
Fidelis said the building’s advanced environmental credentials align with its ESG goals and greater floorspace allows for further growth in Fidelis’ London operations.
“Fidelis is committed to operating responsibly and 22 Bishopsgate allows us to invest further in sustainability,” commented Denise Brown-Branch, group chief operating officer.
“Our London team has also grown exponentially in the past few years, and this new space provides more room for all staff to be on the same floor, encouraging continued and further collaboration among all departments and functions of the business,” said Brown-Branch.
In addition, she said the location allows the company to better serve employees, clients and brokers.
