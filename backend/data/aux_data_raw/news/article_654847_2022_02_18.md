German insurer and asset manager Allianz ALVG.DE on Thursday said it would set aside 3.7 billion euros ($4.20 billion) to deal with investigations and lawsuits resulting from the collapse of a multi-billion-euro set of investment funds.
The provision resulted in a net loss attributable to shareholders of 292 million euros [US$332 million] in the fourth quarter, the company said. Analysts had expected a profit.
