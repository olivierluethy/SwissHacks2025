Suggest to offer quotation line of 7% across all layers except TOP layer at 2%

Total line: Auth Limit: $105.9m gross Premium $3.86m

Quotation Proposal:

Proposed Limit: $105.9m gross Premium $4.0m

Expiring Limit: $80.43m premium 3.22m

Why this opportunity:

Loss occurrence definition tightening, with named event within 72 hours (DEF event now only Eunice). Inuring cat bond on layer 3

of 75m X 275m with loss occurrence at full aggregation (so DEF combined) = more favorable inuring to L3 not factored in modeling

Narrower Peril scope with WS and CS primarily.

Removal of MPL Failure and Marine Clash in top layer last year (not covered in any layers)

Single country exposed

Paid reinstatements

DEF losses reduced another 8% to 146m, however with tighter loss occurrence clause loss would be 132m


Notes

Layer 1: ROL: 21.5%

Layer 2: ROL: 16%

Layer 3: ROL: 5.85%

Layer 4: ROL: 2.75%

Layer 5: ROL: 2%


Structure

Moving the retention up 5m to 90m with some growth. otherwise, structure is the same.

Data

More granularity in the data. Company ABC applied for a waiver so they can use zip code and house number. TIV up 5% and EL's up 2.5%

** Based on application 72 hours period.

Two cat bonds that inure:

1. 75 X 250 inures to L3. Ws + SCS covered.

2. 325 X 375 inuring to L4. Ws + SCS covered.

For cat bond: Hours clause at 72 and loss occurrence aggregation = DEF combined. 142m loss for Company ABC

However, for reinsurance layer, loss occurrence layer 72 hours but named event (tighter wording on 2024 contract) = 132m for

Company ABC. So cat bond will have a bigger benefit than modeling showing.

Company ABC co-share:

L1+2: 10%

L3: 5%

L4 +5: <1%
