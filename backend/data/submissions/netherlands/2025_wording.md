Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Reinsured shall provide Personal Data which has not been anonymised, if necessary for the performance of the Contract and/or legal or regulatory compliance.                                                                                                                              |

| Arbitration                  | Unless the parties agree upon on a single arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of one receiving a written request from the other for arbitration, the claimant (the party requesting arbitration) shall appoint its arbitrator and give written notice thereof to the respondent. Within thirty (30) days of receiving such notice the respondent shall appoint its arbitrator and give written notice thereof to the claimant, failing which the claimant may apply to the appointor hereinafter named to nominate an arbitrator on behalf of the respondent.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Arbitration                  | Before they enter upon a reference the two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator. Should they fail to appoint such a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the respondent's arbitrator then either of them or either of the parties may apply to the appointor for the appointment of the third arbitrator. The three arbitrators shall decide by majority. If no majority can be reached the verdict of the third arbitrator shall prevail. He shall also act as chairman of the tribunal.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|                                                 | Unless the parties otherwise agree the arbitration tribunal shall consist of persons (including those who have retired) with not less than ten (10) years' experience of insurance or reinsurance as persons engaged in the industry itself or as lawyers or other professional advisors. However, under no circumstances shall any member of the arbitration tribunal have any interest in either of the parties, the Contract or the outcome of the arbitration.                                                                                                                                                                  |

|                                                 | The appointor shall be the Nederlands Arbitrage Instituut The Netherlands.

Condition 1

Definition of "Loss Occurrence" - X2625

The term "Loss Occurrence" shall mean all individual insured losses arising out of and directly occasioned by

one event, provided always that the losses concerned shall have the same direct cause, occur during the

same period of time and in the same area. Such cause is understood to be the peril which directly

occasioned the losses. Where there are several perils which, in an unbroken chain of causation, have

occasioned the losses, such cause is understood to be the peril which triggered the chain of causation.

However, the duration and extent of any Loss Occurrence so defined shall be limited to:-

(a) 72 consecutive hours as regards a named storm or unnamed storm or storms including hurricane,

typhoon, windstorm, rainstorm, hailstorm and/or tornado.

In circumstances where a storm is named by a meteorological institute each named storm shall

constitute a single event.

(b) 72 consecutive hours as regards earthquake, seaquake, tidal wave and/or volcanic eruption.

(c) 504 consecutive hours as regards flood.

(d) 72 consecutive hours and within the area of one municipality and the municipalities contiguous thereto

as regards riots, civil commotions, malicious damage and "Klein Molest".

A period of consecutive hours as regards any Loss Occurrence which includes individual loss or

(e)

losses from any of the perils mentioned in (a), (b), (c) and/or (d) above and applying the respective

hours periods for the perils concerned.

However, the maximum duration of the Loss Occurrence so established shall be the longest period of

consecutive hours applying to any of the perils forming part thereof. Within such Loss Occurrence, the

duration of each insured peril shall not exceed the relevant period of consecutive hours specified

above for that peril, which shall also occur entirely within the maximum duration of that Loss

Occurrence.

(f) 504 consecutive hours for any Loss Occurrence of whatsoever nature which does not include

individual loss or losses from any of the perils mentioned in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above.

No individual loss from whatever insured peril, which occurs outside these periods or areas, shall be included

in the Loss Occurrence concerned.

The Reinsured may choose the date and time when any such period of consecutive hours commences and if

any event is of greater duration than the above periods the Reinsured may divide that event into two or more

Loss Occurrences provided no two periods overlap and provided no period commences earlier than the date

and time of the happening of the first recorded individual loss to the Reinsured in that event.

In circumstances where consecutively occurring Loss Occurrences arise and it is impossible for the

Reinsured to determine the particular Loss Occurrence which has caused any loss or losses which are

covered hereunder, the Reinsured shall allocate such loss or losses to the Loss Occurrence, which most

likely occasioned the loss or losses concerned.

Condition 2

Extended Expiration - X1012

If this Contract should expire or be terminated while a Loss Occurrence covered by this Contract is in

progress, it is understood and agreed that subject to the other terms and conditions of this Contract, the

Reinsurers hereon are responsible as if the entire loss or damage had occurred prior to the expiration or

termination of this Contract, provided that no part of that Loss Occurrence is claimed against any renewal or

replacement of this Contract.

Condition 3

Ultimate Net Loss (Based on - X2303)

The term "Ultimate Net Loss" shall mean the sum actually paid or payable by the Reinsured in respect of any

loss, including expenses of litigation, if any, and all other loss expenses of the Reinsured, (excluding,

however, office expenses and salaries of employees of the Reinsured). However, salaries and expenses of

assessors and technical experts employed by the Reinsured on a permanent basis shall be included in the

Ultimate Net Loss, but only to the extent that such salaries and expenses are related to the assessment of

claims affecting this Contract. Salvages and recoveries, including recoveries from all other reinsurances,

whether collected or not, other than underlying excess of loss reinsurances, if any, shall be first deducted

from such loss to arrive at the amount of liability, if any, attaching hereunder.

Nothing in this clause shall be construed to mean that a payment by Reinsurers under this Contract cannot

be made until the Ultimate Net Loss of the Reinsured has been finally ascertained

Condition 4

Salvages - X1023

All salvages, recoveries or payments recovered or received subsequent to any loss settlement hereunder

shall be applied as if recovered or received prior to the aforesaid settlement and all necessary adjustments

shall be made by the parties hereto. Nothing in this condition shall be construed to mean that a recovery

cannot be made hereunder until the Reinsured's Ultimate Net Loss has been ascertained.

Condition 5

Net Retained Lines

This Contract shall only protect that portion of any business covered hereunder which the Reinsured retains

net for its own account. Reinsurers' liability hereunder shall not be increased due to the inability of the

Reinsured to collect from any other reinsurers any amounts which may have become due from them whether

such inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurers or otherwise.

Condition 6

Rates of Exchange - X2433

For the purpose of this Contract, currencies other than Euro (EUR) shall be converted into such currency at

the rates of exchange used in the Reinsured's books, or where there is a specific remittance for a loss

settlement hereunder, at the rates of exchange applying when the Reinsurer makes the payment to the

Reinsured.

Condition 7

Notification of Claims (Based on - X1637)

The Reinsured undertakes to advise the Reinsurers in writing as soon as a claim is likely to exceed 75% of

the deductible, together with an estimate of the Reinsurers' liability and thereafter keep the Reinsurers fully

Page 10 X

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

Contract X

informed of any developments regarding the claim.

Condition 8

Loss Settlements (Based on ~ X2226)

All loss settlements made by the Reinsured, provided same are within the terms and conditions of the

original business covered hereunder and within the terms and conditions of this Contract, shall be

unconditionally binding upon the Reinsurers and amounts falling to the share of the Reinsurers shall be

payable by them within fourteen days upon reasonable evidence of the amount paid or payable being given

by the Reinsured. Nevertheless, the provisions of this clause shall not be construed to accelerate the

payment of loss settlement hereunder.

Payments made by the Reinsured to the Insured where the Reinsured is not liable (that is ex-gratia

payments) shall only be binding upon the Reinsurer where its approval is obtained prior to the payment.

Condition 9

Offset ~ X1548

The Reinsured or the Reinsurers shall have and may exercise at any time the right to offset any balance or

balances whether on account of premiums or on account of losses or otherwise due from one party to the

other under the terms of this Contract.

Condition 10

Inspection of Records (Based on ~ X2557)

The Reinsurers or representatives duly authorised by them may at any time during normal office hours of the

Reinsured inspect records and/or documents of the Reinsured which relate to the business covered under

this Contract, other than records and/or documents which are designated as legally privileged. Legally

privileged records and/or documents shall include those that are subject to the work product doctrine, in

applicable jurisdictions.

The inspection may be undertaken either at a place to be mutually agreed between the parties, or

alternatively the inspection may be carried out virtually. A virtual inspection is subject to the mutual consent

of the parties and such inspection shall be carried out subject to the conditions as agreed by them.

The Reinsurers' right of inspection shall continue as long as either party has a claim against the other arising

out of this Contract or whilst any liability remains hereunder.

A request for an inspection shall be made by the Reinsurer at least fourteen (14) days in advance.

The inspection shall last no longer than ten (10) working days unless otherwise agreed by both parties.

An inspection request shall clearly set out which records and/or documents the Reinsured will be required to

make available for inspection and the name of person or persons who will be appointed to carry out the

inspection. During the course of the inspection, the Reinsurer may request additional records and/or

documents to be made available to inspect.

The Reinsurer is permitted to take or receive copies of the Reinsured's records and/or documents, which

form part of the inspection concerned, at the Reinsurer's own expense.

Where the Reinsurer is unable to inspect and take copies of the Reinsured's records and/or documents

because they are designated as legally privileged, the Reinsured shall take all reasonable steps to provide

the Reinsurer with the information it requires without compromising the legally privileged status of such

records and/or documents.

A request to inspect the Reinsured's records and/or documents shall not entitle the Reinsurers to withhold

any undisputed balances due to the Reinsured under this Contract. If the undisputed balances due from the

Reinsurers hereunder have not been paid, the Reinsurers shall not have access to any of the Reinsured's

records and/or documents until the undisputed balances have been fully paid.

Page 11 X

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

Contract X

Should arbitration or judicial proceedings, including any pre-action protocols, be pending or initiated between

the parties, the Reinsurers' right of inspection under this Contract shall not apply, and will be subject to the

discovery process with respect to that arbitration or judicial proceeding.

Condition 11

Confidentiality (Based on ~ X2286)

All terms and conditions of this Contract and any materials provided in connection therewith, including

renewal information and claims data (herein referred to as "Confidential Information") are confidential to the

Reinsured and shall be kept strictly confidential by the Reinsurers hereon and not disclosed to third parties,

other than as provided below.

The Reinsurers agree that the Confidential Information shall only be used for their own underwriting, risk

management, internal administration, claims handling and accounting purposes, and otherwise for the

purposes of performance of this Contract.

The Reinsurers are permitted to disclose the Confidential Information to the following:

Their directors and employees and the directors and employees of their group affiliates, who are

responsible for this Contract or are required to review or process the Confidential Information in respect

of this Contract;

Their out-sourcing organisations and third party service providers, including any market administration

bureaux, who undertake administrative roles in respect of the Reinsurers' performance and obligations

under this Contract; subject to a written confidentiality agreement being in place between the Reinsurer

and such organisation or service provider which is no less stringent than the provisions of this clause;

Their external professional advisors, legal counsel, representatives, actuaries, accountants or auditors;

Their retrocessionaires for the purposes of its own reinsurance/retrocession protections;

Their internal legal counsel;

Governmental authorities, regulators performing an audit of the Reinsurers' records and/or financial

condition;

An arbitrator, mediator or umpire in any dispute resolution proceeding between the Reinsured and the

Reinsurer pursuant to the terms of this Contract;

Any other third party if agreed by the Reinsured in writing prior to the disclosure.

The Reinsurers shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions of this clause by any of the entities

noted in the preceding paragraph.

In circumstances where Confidential Information is stored on a group wide information technology facility and

is used for administration, risk management, claims handling, business analysis and accounting purposes

and is therefore accessible to other members of that group, the Reinsurers shall take every precaution to

ensure that the integrity and appropriate level of confidentiality is maintained.

Confidential Information shall not include information which:

the Reinsurers are already lawfully in possession of prior to disclosure by the Reinsured;

was in the public domain at the time of the communication of such Confidential Information to the

Reinsurers by the Reinsured or its designated agents;

entered the public domain, through no fault of the Reinsurers, subsequent to the time of the

Reinsurers' receipt of the Confidential Information from the Reinsured or its designated agents,

without violating any of the Reinsurers' obligations under this Contract; or

is lawfully made available to the Reinsurers by a third party who is free to make such disclosure

without breach of any legal obligation;

the Reinsurers develop independently;

The duty of confidentiality does not apply where disclosure has to be made as a result of subpoena or other

duly-issued order of a court or other governmental agency or regulatory authority.

In the event that the Reinsurers are required by a court order, other legal process or any regulatory authority

Page 12 X

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

Contract X

to release or disclose any or all of the Confidential Information, the Reinsurers agree to provide the

Reinsured with written notice of same as soon as practicable, where allowed by applicable law and to use

reasonable efforts to assist the Reinsured in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in this clause, as far

as legally possible.

Condition 12

Severability ~ X2177

If any provision of this Contract shall be rendered to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with the

law of any applicable jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this

Contract shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Condition 13

Errors and Omissions ~ X1014

Any inadvertent error or omission on the part of either the Reinsured or the Reinsurers shall not relieve either

party from any liability which would have attached to this Contract and such error or omission shall be

rectified immediately upon discovery. Nevertheless, nothing in this clause shall be held to override any of the

terms and conditions of this Contract and no liability shall be imposed on either party greater than would

have attached hereunder if the error or omission had not occurred.

Condition 14

Termination and Insolvency

Either party shall have the right to terminate this Contract forthwith, without prior notice, upon the happening

of any of the following events:

I. If any law or regulation should become operative in the country in which either of the parties resides,

or has its principal office, rendering illegal the arrangements made hereby.

II. If the country or territory in which the Reinsurer(s) reside or have their head office or are incorporated

shall be involved in war with the country or territory in which the Reinsured reside or have their head

more than fifty percent (50%) of the Reinsurer's outstanding voting securities or rights to acquire

such securities.

Notice of termination in accordance with any of the provisions of the clause shall be given in writing (with proof

of receipt by the other party).

In the event of this Contract being cancelled at any date other than stated under Period, then the Premium

due to the Reinsurers shall be calculated upon either:

a) the Premium Income of the Reinsured up to the date of termination grossed up to the full year at pro

rata temporis,

or

Page 13 X

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

Contract X

the minimum premium, whichever is the greater, or

b) the flat premium, if applicable.

Return premium is then calculated using the following allocation of the premium over the four quarters based

upon an estimation of the relative seasonal exposure:

| January to March:    | 40% |
| -------------------- | --- |
| April to June:       | 10% |
| July to September:   | 10% |
| October to December: | 40% |

When cancellation is mid-quarter, the premium calculation for that particular quarter will be based upon pro

rata temporis of the applicable percentage for the quarter, shown above.

Any reinstatement premium that may be payable shall be based upon the full annual premium calculated in

accordance with the premium provisions under "Reinstatement Provisions", and will not form part of any

return premium payable hereunder.

Notwithstanding the above provisions, in the event that the Reinsurer is subject to a 'Default or Insolvency', a

'Credit Event' or a 'Withdrawal', as described under items 1-3 below, the Reinsured shall be informed thereof

by the Reinsurer without delay, but at the latest five (5) days of such circumstance occurring. The Reinsured

only shall then have the right to seek modification of the Contract terms and conditions or to terminate this

Contract in accordance with the provisions of this clause in respect of all business in-force at the date of

termination, (active policies and outstanding claims) with immediate effect unless indicated otherwise within

this clause.

1. Default or Insolvency Event

Failure by the Reinsurer to make, when due, any payment of liability or any other amount under the

a.

Contract required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the fifth (5) Business

Day after notice of such failure is given to the Reinsurer. For the avoidance of doubt failure of the

institutions to deliver the payments once a corresponding instruction by the Reinsurer has been

made, does not constitute a failure to pay under the Contract;

The Reinsurer (1) does not meet its obligations under the Contract (other than an obligation to

b.

make any payment under the Contract) despite a written reminder and such failure is not remedied

on or before the thirtieth (30) calendar day after notice of such failure is given to the Reinsurer; or

(2) the Reinsurer disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, its obligations

under the Contract (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to

operate it or act on its behalf);

C. The Reinsurer (1) is dissolved; (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits

in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general

assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or has

instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief

under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors' rights, or a petition

is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition

instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency

or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or

liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within sixty (60)

days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official

management or liquidation; (6) seeks or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator,

provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, Trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all

or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all its

assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, seizure or other legal process levied, enforced or

sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession,

or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within sixty

(60) days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the law as

Page 14 X

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

Contract X

specified in Law and Jurisdiction for this Contract, has an analogous effect to any of the events

specified in paragraphs (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating

its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts (each of (1) to (8)),

2. Credit event:

if the Reinsurer ceases to maintain an A.M. Best, S&P, Fitch, Moody's long term foreign currency

issuer credit rating of A- (in case of A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch) or A3 (in case of Moody's), or if the

Reinsurer is rated by more than one of the above rating agencies, and the rating of either of these

four agencies drop below A- (A3 in case of Moody's),

3. Withdrawal:

If the Reinsurer withdraws from underwriting any of the classes of business protected hereunder.

Furthermore, the Reinsured only shall also have the right to terminate this Contract forthwith, without prior

notice, if the portfolios protected hereunder are controlled by any company or corporation, other than those

mentioned under Reinsured.

In the event of this Contract being terminated at a date other than the expiry date mentioned under Period,

the premium(s) due by the Reinsured to the Reinsurer(s) shall be either in accordance with the premium

calculation referred to and based upon the Reinsured's Premium Income recorded in its books as from the

date of commencement up to such other termination date, or be a pro rata temporis share of the minimum

premium, specified under Premium, whichever is the greater.

Any reinstatement premium that may be payable shall be based upon the full annual premium calculated in

accordance with the premium provisions under Reinstatement Provisions, and will not form part of any return

premium hereunder.

Insolvency of the Reinsured: Reinsurance Coverage

Where an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the Reinsured the following terms shall apply (and, in the

event of any inconsistency between these terms and any other terms of this Contract, these terms shall

prevail):

(1) Notwithstanding any requirement in this Contract that the Reinsured shall actually make payment in

discharge of its liability to its original policyholder before becoming entitled to payment from the

Reinsurer(s):

(a) the Reinsurer(s) shall be liable to pay the Reinsured even though the Reinsured is unable

actually to pay, or discharge its liability to, its original policyholder

(b) nothing in this clause shall operate to accelerate the date for payment by the Reinsurer(s) of

any sum which may be payable to the Reinsured, which sum shall only become payable as and

when the Reinsured would have discharged, by actual payment, its liability for its current net

loss but for it being the subject of an Insolvency Event.

(2) The existence, quantum, valuation and date for payment of any sums which the Reinsurer(s) are liable

to pay the Reinsured under this Contract shall be those and only those for which the Reinsurer(s)

would be liable to the Reinsured if the liability of the Reinsured to its original policyholders had been

determined without reference to any term in any composition or scheme of arrangement or any similar

such arrangement, entered into between the Reinsured and all or any part of its original policyholders,

unless and until the Reinsurer(s) serve written notice to the contrary on the Reinsured in relation to

any composition or scheme of arrangement or any similar arrangement.

(3) The Reinsurer(s) shall be entitled (but not obliged) to set-off, against any sum which they may be

liable to pay to the Reinsured, any sum for which the Reinsured is liable to pay to the Reinsurer(s).

In the event of any further legislation being enacted after the commencement of this Contract, extending

materially the liability of parties involved, the Reinsured and the Slip Leader agree to take up for immediate

discussion the terms and conditions upon which this Contract shall continue, these terms and conditions

binding all Reinsurers.

In the event of the parties hereto failing to agree upon such terms and conditions within six (6) months after

the effective date of any change in law, this Contract shall operate from the effective date of the change of

Information

4. Memorandum of Understanding - Condition 1 - Definition of "Loss Occurrence"

The following memorandum of understanding regarding the Definition of "Loss Occurrence" is noted and

agreed between Reinsured and Reinsurer:

First paragraph:

As regards the following text: "Such cause is understood to be the peril which directly occasioned the

losses. Where there are several perils which, in an unbroken chain of causation, have occasioned

the losses, such cause is understood to be the peril which triggered the chain of causation."

It is noted and agreed that the intention of the clause is that it refers to those losses whereby the

direct cause of the loss originates from the insured event. The peril which occurs first and triggers

further chain of insured events occasioning the losses is deemed to be the direct cause of all such

losses. Example: Subsequent Fire losses caused directly by windstorm. It is understood that these

Fire losses are part of the Loss Occurrence caused by windstorm.

Second paragraph, point (a):

It is noted and agreed between Reinsured and Reinsurer, that the second paragraph under (a)

'where a storm is named refers to a named storms coverage for European windstorms according

to the following clarification:

Unities Test

one event

arising out of and Defined Time

occasioned by directly Defined Space (geo.)

Same Cause

All individual losses

Loss Occurrence

With regards to the peril of European windstorms, one event as referred to in the "Loss Occurrence"

definition means one single named storm. European windstorm in that sense means the "classical"

named European windstorm (also referred to as European winter storm or European extra-tropical

cyclone) that occurs in the colder months.

Examples:

Dec 1999: Lothar/Martin: Two distinct windstorms

Page 24 X

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

Contract X

Feb 2022: Dudley/Eunice/Franklin: Three distinct windstorms

"Named" in that context means that a name was assigned to the storm by an official meteorological

agency such as KNMI, Free University of Berlin, DWD, UK Met Office, etc., For the avoidance of

doubt, one and the same storm may be assigned different names by different agencies.

This memorandum of understanding does not apply to interpretation of the terms and conditions of

any reinsurance contract(s) entered into between the parties unless specifically referred to therein.

|                        | Where this Contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted ("signed"). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this Contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this Contract underwritten by each Reinsurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd's syndicate taken together) is referred to as a "signed line". The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Signing Provisions    | In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, lines will be signed down in equal proportions so that the aggregate signed lines are equal to 100% of the order without further agreement of any of the Reinsurers.

| Signing Provisions    | a) In the event that the placement order is not completed by the commencement date of the Period of this Contract then all lines written by that date will be signed in full;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Signing Provisions    | b) The Reinsured may elect for the disproportionate signing of Reinsurers lines, without further specific agreement of Reinsurers, providing that any such variation is made prior to the commencement date of the Period of this Contract,                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Signing Provisions    | c) The signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the Period of this Contract, by the documented agreement of the Reinsured and all Reinsurers whose lines are to be varied. The variation to this Contract will take effect only when all such Reinsurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that agreement. |
| Signing Provisions    | The signed line will be entered on the respective Reinsurer signing page by the Intermediary and shall be notified to the Reinsurer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Written Lines         | In a co-reinsurance placement, following Reinsurers may, but are not obliged to, follow the premium charged by the Slip Leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
