Schlatter Industries’ network was attacked with malware on Friday and it can be assumed this was a professional attack, the Switzerland-based company said on Monday.
The group was hit on Friday by a cyberattack using malware, and the unknown perpetrators were attempting to “blackmail Schlatter,” it said, disclosing no further details.
The group was investigating whether data was stolen and experts were working to make all systems available and functional again, Schlatter said.
The engineering company said it immediately initiated security measures and involved the relevant authorities.
