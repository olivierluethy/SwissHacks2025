Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. has delisted and canceled trading from the London Stock Exchange, further to its announcement made on Oct. 27, 2023.
The delisting was finalized at 8:00 a.m. (GMT) on Nov. 27, 2023.
The company continues to maintain its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
At the time of the original announcement in October, Marsh & McLennan explained the move by saying that the majority of trading in the company’s securities occurs on the NYSE as its primary listing. Therefore, the costs and administrative burden of maintaining its presence at the LSE were disproportionate to the benefits.
