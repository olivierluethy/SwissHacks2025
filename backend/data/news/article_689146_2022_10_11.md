Lloyd’s of London said on Monday that its investigation into a possible cyberattack had found no evidence of data compromise.
“The investigation has concluded that no evidence of any compromise was found and as such Lloyd’s has been advised that its network services can now be restored,” a company spokesperson said in an email.
The commercial insurance market detected unusual activity on its network, it said last week, putting companies on high alert for intrusions as a result of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
