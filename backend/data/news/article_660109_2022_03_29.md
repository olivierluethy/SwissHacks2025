Lloyd’s CEO John Neal was involved in a collision with a car while riding his bike on Saturday, March 26, Lloyd’s said in a statement.

Neal sustained serious injuries and is undergoing treatment in hospital, but he is expected to make a full recovery.
While Neal recovers, Lloyd’s will be led by Burkhard Keese, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, and Patrick Tiernan, chief of markets, Lloyd’s said, adding that they will receive support from Lloyd’s wider executive committee as well as oversight from Lloyd’s Chairman Bruce Carnegie Brown.
Neal became CEO of Lloyd’s in October 2018 after five years as CEO of QBE Insurance.
