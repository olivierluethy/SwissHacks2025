The verdict is in: Londoners enjoy and value working from home and don’t see a future that includes a return to the old five-day office week, no matter what politicians, their bosses or the media say.
Almost 80% of London-based staff who now work remotely at least once a week say the experience has been good for them, according to a report published on Wednesday by the Policy Institute at King’s College London. Four out of five say working from home helps them feel more in control and that they’re happy to cut down on their daily commute. Two-thirds say it’s helped them better manage home and family responsibilities.
