One in six (17%) young drivers admit to being on a ‘fronted’ policy, which is illegal, according to research by United Kingdom insurer Aviva.
Fronting is a form of insurance fraud where the young driver is listed as a named driver on their parents’ policy, despite being the main driver of the car.
The research involving more than 2,000 young drivers (aged 17-25) showed that whilst most young drivers are honest when they apply for insurance, just over one-third (35%) thought that “lying on my car insurance application is a victimless crime.”
“Fronting is a serious issue that not only constitutes insurance fraud but also puts young drivers at significant risk,” said Katriona Cunningham, underwriting fraud lead at Aviva.
“While it may be tempting for a few young drivers to try to be clever with the truth, it’s important that they understand the consequences of driving without adequate insurance.”
Just half (51%) of young drivers realised they could face a driving ban for driving without adequate insurance, while 45% understood that their car can also be seized by the police as a result. Only one-third (35%) knew that they could be forced to pay a fine.
According to the insurer, it matters because insurance premiums are determined by the risk profile of the main driver, and thus insurers need to know who that person is. Misrepresenting details about the driver’s age, claims history, and other data as well as driving on a fronted policy, can lead to the policy being invalidated, as these actions breach the policy terms and conditions and are considered both fraudulent and illegal.
