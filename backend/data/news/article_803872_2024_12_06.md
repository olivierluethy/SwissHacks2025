Chinaâ€™s financial regulator unveiled a plan on Friday to enhance supervision and support the development of the property insurance industry, according to a statement.
The country will support qualified foreign financial institutions to invest in its property insurance market, and encourage domestic property insurance companies to optimize their offshore expansion, the statement said.
Additionally, the plan includes studying policy measures to promote the development of new energy vehicle insurance.
