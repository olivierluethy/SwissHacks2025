Air travelers in South Korea may be asked to seal up the ports on their handheld battery rechargers or put them in a separate plastic bag after an in-cabin fire on an Air Busan Co. plane last month.
South Korea’s transport ministry said it will strengthen regulations on the handling of batteries by passengers in the cabin amid a wave of safety concerns around the cells in people’s carry-on luggage.
The tighter rules are in response to a fire that broke out as an Air Busan plane was preparing for takeoff, forcing the evacuation of 176 passengers and crew. The Airbus SE plane was later totally engulfed in flames.
Video footage from the incident showed the fire started in an overhead cabin baggage unit.
