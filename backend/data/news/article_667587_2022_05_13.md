Insurer AXA and consumer goods group Unilever plan to invest 100 million euros each into a new 1 billion euro ($1.06 billion) regenerative agriculture fund to be managed by Tikehau Capital, the three groups said on Wednesday.
The companies each aim to invest 100 million euros [$105.6 million] into the fund. They said they signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a new private equity “impact” fund dedicated to enhancing biodiversity and mitigating climate change by scaling up regenerative farming, which companies and governments see as a way to help meet targets to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
