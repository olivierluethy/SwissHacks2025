Atos SE said a ransomware group called Space Bears claimed on Saturday to have compromised an Atos database.The French technology company, whose activities include cybersecurity as well as cloud and high-performance computing, said there’s no evidence so far that its systems were affected, and no ransom demand has been received.
Atos said its cybersecurity team is actively investigating.
The announcement comes nine days after Atos said it completed a financial restructuring, with its creditors taking control of the company. (Editor’s note: Paris-based Atos provided an official security statement on Dec. 29, which is available here).
