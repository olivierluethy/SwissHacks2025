The board of Generali on Monday reappointed Philippe Donnet as chief executive with 10 votes in favor out of 13, two sources said, after a group of rebel Italian investors seeking to oust him lost out in a shareholder vote last week.
The two sources with knowledge of the matter said Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who led the opposition to Donnet and is Generali’s No.2 investor with a 9.95% stake, voted against his reappointment. Generali declined to comment.
