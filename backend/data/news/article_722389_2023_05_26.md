Mawar is now one of the three strongest storms ever to hit the North Pacific in May and is the undisputed most powerful — in terms of windspeed — of 2023 so far, according to Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. But there is still a lot of year left.
Its winds have peaked at 180 miles per hour on the US scale. The super typhoon is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, which usually weakens beasts like this. Its structure is also showing a little asymmetry, which also indicates weakening, according to the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The good news for the world is that there isn’t much in Mawar’s way right now and the forecast calls for it to turn away from Taiwan in the next week.
Meanwhile, a potential frontal boundary off the east coast of Florida has a 10% chance of spinning itself into a tropical cyclone of some sort in the next seven days. We’ll see.
