CFC, the specialist managing general agent, announced the launch of a dedicated Innovation Hub.
Located in new premises on Whittington Avenue in the City of London, CFC’s Innovation Hub will act as CFC’s research and development center supporting over 100 tech engineers and has the capacity to accommodate the anticipated future growth of this team.
“We have one of the most sophisticated and fastest growing tech teams in insurance, but as our Gracechurch Street HQ nears capacity, we’ve taken the opportunity to create a space that is dedicated solely to our technology organization,” said Jon Fletcher, chief technology officer (CTO) at CFC. “The space has been designed to support the collaborative and hybrid working habits in which our engineers and developers thrive, as well as foster the unique culture that CFC is known for.”
Using cutting edge technologies, automation and data science, CFC’s tech team is delivering solutions that enable CFC to break new ground in specialty lines risk selection, pricing and preventative capabilities.
“We’re an insurance business that has embraced technology from day one, not only to help our underwriters make smarter, faster decisions but critically to help our policyholders prevent claims before they happen,” commented Fletcher. “Technology underpins everything we do at CFC, and I hope that the creation of our dedicated Innovation Hub will help us attract and retain top-tier talent.”
