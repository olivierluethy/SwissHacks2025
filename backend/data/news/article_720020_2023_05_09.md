The rollout of the Lloyd’s cyber war exclusions has received considerable criticism for the chaos and confusion caused in the weeks leading up to the March 31st effective date. But there are some certainties to keep in mind about the new regime.
For example, a compliant cyber war exclusion must be included in policies purchased through Lloyd’s – it’s not voluntary. Also, the most commonly used exclusion – LMA5567A/B – does not exclude state-sponsored cyber attacks, unless certain thresholds are met – the most notable of which is that the insured digital assets must be located in a state that has suffered a “major detrimental impact.”
And another important fact is that the LMA’s exclusions can be revised, provided they adhere to Lloyd’s requirements listed in Lloyd’s Market Bulletin Y5381.
This article is the first of a series with a coming article focusing on thoughts from brokers and insurers about the new Lloyd’s cyber war regime.
