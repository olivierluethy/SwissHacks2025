Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BHSI) announced the introduction of new property damage, general liability, D&O, professional indemnity and marine cargo insurance policies in Spain.
“Launching our proprietary policy wordings in Spain is indicative of our commitment to leading domestic and international insurance programs for customers,” said Eduardo Guinea, head of Customer and Broker Engagement for Spain, BHSI. “Each of these new policies reflect BHSI’s simple, clearly understood wordings and deliver the certainty of comprehensive, flexible coverage to customers.”
BHSI said it underwrites on a net capacity basis, without accessing the reinsurance markets, which vests the company with flexibility in designing coverage and facilitates responsive, local decision-making.
“The introduction of these new policies is an important step in our steady expansion in Spain. We look forward to continuing to grow, hiring talented professionals, launching new products, entering new segments, and expanding our geographical presence,” said Constanza Gallegos, country manager for Spain, BHSI.
The new policies are available immediately in Spain. For more information, contact: constanza.gallegos@bhspecialty.com.
