The UK said three government bodies are working together to challenge Russian shadow fleet oil tankers if it perceives they have dubious insurance.
An announcement from the country’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office didn’t specify how such interventions would occur, or how insistent the UK would be. However, it said the Department for Transport, the Joint Maritime Security Centre and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency are working together to challenge ships over what cover they have.
In the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, Moscow established a shadow fleet of vessels in order to keep its supplies moving. That prompted worries that the ships are operating outside of international regulatory and safety standards, including uncertain insurance, with the international watchdog that oversees shipping voicing concern about dark fleet activities late last year.
The UK also designated 18 oil tankers and four liquefied national gas carriers Thursday, the FCDO said in a statement. That represents its largest set of sanctions on ships hauling fossil fuels for Moscow to date.
Thursday’s measures bring the total number of ships designated by the UK to 43, the FCDO said.
Of the steady stream of ships sanctioned by the US, European Union and UK to date, almost a third are already back at work. Measures imposed by the UK have been the least effective so far.
