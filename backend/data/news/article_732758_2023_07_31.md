Global commercial insurance pricing rose 3% in the second quarter of 2023, down from 4% in Q1, according to Marsh, which pointed to two notable trends during Q2: a moderation in cyber rates and continuing challenges in property insurance, which saw the largest increases of any major product line.
This was the 23rd consecutive quarter in which composite pricing rose, continuing the longest run of increases since the inception of the index in 2012, commented the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index, noting that price hikes peaked at 22% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Global average composite pricing was relatively consistent across regions — driven largely by rate decreases for financial and professional lines (down 8% in Q2 versus a 5% drop in Q1) and either decreases or moderating increases for cyber insurance, Marsh said.
Overall average pricing for financial and professional lines fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by rate reductions and additional capacity – particularly in the UK — where FinPro lines declined 6%, compared to a 4% decline in the first quarter. In addition, D&O pricing continued to decline in the UK, generally in the 10%-15% range.
Global cyber insurance pricing increases also moderated to 1%, compared to 11% in the prior quarter and 28% in Q4 2022. The drop in cyber premiums “was driven by significant moderation in the US, which saw average price decreases of 4%, compared to 11% increases in Q1 [2023],” the report continued.
On the other hand, global property insurance experienced the largest rate increases of any major product line, with average global prices increasing by 10% (level with Q1), Marsh said.
Breaking the composite pricing down by region, Marsh said, Q2 prices in the UK increased by 1% (down from a 3% increase in Q1 of 2023); in the Pacific they increased by 2% (down from 7% in Q1), and was flat in Asia (down from 1% in Q1).
The remaining regions recorded identical increases to the previous quarter: in Latin America and the Caribbean pricing increased by 8% (8% in Q1); in Continental Europe by 5% (5% in Q1); and in the US by 4% (4% in Q1).
Marsh noted that concerns about the impact of inflation on asset values and claims costs remained a key focus for insurers at renewal in most regions.
US Market Trends
Although Marsh goes on to take a deep dive into each of the global markets, Insurance Journal focuses here on US pricing for property, casualty, financial and professional lines (FINPRO), and cyber.
All references to pricing and pricing movements in this report are averages, unless otherwise noted. For ease of reporting, Marsh rounded all percentages regarding pricing movements to the nearest whole number.
