Bermuda-based global specialty insurance firm R&Q Insurance Holdings said on Friday it would divest its insurance and program management business, Accredited, to Onex Corp. for an enterprise value of $465 million.
Proceeds from the sale, expected to be around $300 million, would be used to significantly pare R&Q’s debt.
The sale, likely to close by the first half of 2024, is conditional on transfer of R&Q’s chief executive officer, William Spiegel, and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Solomon to Accredited upon closing.

After the deal’s closing, group Non-Executive Chairman Jeff Hayman would be appointed as chairman and interim CEO of R&Q, while company insider Paul Bradbrook would be appointed as CFO.
R&Q in April had said it was reviewing strategic options to separate Accredited and its legacy insurance business.
