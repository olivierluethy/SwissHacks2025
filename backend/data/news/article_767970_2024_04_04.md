Howden Tiger, the global reinsurance arm of Howden, will rename as Howden Re, effective April 8, 2024.
This strategic change follows Howden’s rebrand in October last year, which united its broking operations under one name. Today, with its reinsurance business following suit, Howden expresses its collective expertise through a single visual identity, the company said.
Howden said its reinsurance business has consistently outperformed the market since the company’s acquisition of TigerRisk in January 2023. It was the fastest growing reinsurance intermediary in 2023, with 25% organic growth for the full year. Gross written premiums for the year surged to $14.5 billion, with the division doubling geographic and office presence, while attracting some of the industry’s leading talent. It now operates with a team of nearly 900 professionals across 30 countries.
Looking ahead, Howden Re aims to continue expanding its international footprint, building scale in product and expertise, and attracting top talent through a people-first culture, focused on empowerment and an entrepreneurial approach.
Founded in 1994, Howden operates in 55 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, the USA, Australia and New Zealand, employing 17,000 people and handling $38 billion of premium on behalf of clients.
