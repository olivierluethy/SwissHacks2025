Six Bermudian students will be learning about the global reinsurance industry this summer as part of an internship program with Ariel Re in Bermuda.
The interns will learn about a variety of roles within the sector, including operations and finance, catastrophe modelling, underwriting, claims, and actuarial science.
As well as learning how individual departments work and attending daily meetings, the interns will also benefit from lunch and learn sessions where they will gain insights into the wider reinsurance industry.
This year sees the highest number of students taking part in the internship program, which includes a paid salary.
