Russia’s Aeroflot has finalized insurance settlements with leasing companies for seven more planes, it said on Friday.
Planes leased by Russian airlines from foreign leasing companies have been in limbo since sanctions were imposed over Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine in February 2022.
Russian airlines have tried to buy out the planes, rather than return them to the leasing companies.
