Instead of oscillating between extreme hard and soft markets, the insurance industry needs to promote a more sustainable business model that will help control the insurance cycle, according to an executive at the insurer Markel UK.
And perhaps the ongoing hard market presents an opportunity for the industry to reset some long-held practices, indicated Nic Brown, divisional director – Broker, Markel UK, who participated in a panel discussion on the hard market at the recent annual conference of the British Insurance Brokers’ Association (BIBA), held in Manchester, England.
