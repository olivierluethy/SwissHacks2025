Private and public insurance entities saw an estimated $15 billion of global losses during the first quarter – close to both average and median losses of the last 10 years, according to Aon’s Q1 Global Catastrophe Recap Report.
However, potential loss development is likely to increase the total further. Aon said.
On the other hand, global economic natural disaster losses of $63 billion (which include both insured and non-insured losses) were well above average when compared to the 21st Century baseline of $53 billion and significantly higher than the median of $38 billion (which is not skewed by the record year of 2011), Aon said.
These economic losses were largely driven by the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, which had a price tag of approximately $39.1 billion and comprised more than half of total global, said Aon, noting that the final toll could be significantly higher, as the entire amount of actual physical damage will likely not be settled for months to come.
Key additional findings from the report include:
