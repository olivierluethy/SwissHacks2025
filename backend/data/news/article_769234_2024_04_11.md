Almost half the world’s population will go to the polls before the end of 2024, which raises the threat of political violence and possible large insurance losses, according to Allianz Commercial in a new report.
An unprecedented “super-cycle” of elections around the world this year “create the potential for conflict and unrest, with rising extremism and misinformation compounding the threat,” said the report titled “Managing the increasing threat of political violence and civil unrest.”
While large-scale terrorist attacks were the biggest losses in the political violence and terrorism insurance space in recent years, this has now been overtaken in certain regions by major losses from strikes, riots, and civil commotion (SRCC) events, the report added.

“As unrest can now spread more quickly and widely – thanks in part to the power of social media – financial costs are mounting,” said the report, noting that economic and insured losses from such activity can be considerable, resulting in significant losses for companies and their insurers.
“For example, economic and insured losses from just seven civil unrest incidents in recent years cost approximately $13 billion.” (See sidebar for a list of these events).
