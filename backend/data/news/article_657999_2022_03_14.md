India aims to launch its $8 billion listing of state-run Life Insurance Corp. (LIC) by mid-April, two government sources said, after delaying what will be the country’s biggest ever IPO from this month due to market volatility.
The government aims to raise more than $8 billion by selling a 5% stake in the country’s biggest insurance company. It had planned to launch it by the end of this fiscal year on March 31 but delayed the issue after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made financial markets highly volatile.
