Ditching investments in fossil fuel businesses—and denying them insurance—aren’t the only ways for the insurance industry to participate in the drive to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, according to representatives of global insurers and reinsurers.
Even those companies that are continuing to insure the oil and gas industry can push the global transition to net zero forward by helping facilitate the growth of essential carbon removal technologies, they say.
But the insurance market for carbon removal is still in its early stages, as insurers tread carefully given the lack of loss history in an emerging sector. (See related article: The Global Urgency of Building the Carbon Removal Industry for how the insurance industry can help build the carbon removal sector.)
Some companies, such as Chubb, are continuing to insure oil and gas while also helping to push net zero transition. Chubb has exited the insurance of coal and tar sands, which have “true sustainability issues,” but is continuing to insure oil and gas because the world doesn’t yet have “great alternatives,” according to CEO Evan Greenberg, who spoke at the recent 38th Annual S&P Global Ratings Insurance Conference.
He said Chubb is developing products to support industries “that are either helping companies and individuals reduce their carbon footprint or create new technologies that produce energy that are carbon free.”
“The insurance industry is perfectly positioned to help facilitate the growth of the carbon removal industry via derisking, financing and purchasing new carbon removal services,” said Mischa Repmann, senior sustainability risk manager at Swiss Re, in an interview.
“This is where re/insurers with appetite for the journey can play to their strengths,” said a Swiss Re Institute report titled “The insurance rationale for carbon removal solutions,” which was published in July 2021.
Three Transition Levers
As risk takers, institutional investors and buyers, Swiss Re said, insurance and reinsurance companies can help scale up the carbon removal industry in three ways:
For example, insurers can improve “the bankability of carbon removal projects by providing compensation for losses in the case of adverse events,” the report said. It explained that standard engineering policies, such as contractors all-risk policies, “can cover the construction, operation and deconstruction risks of carbon removal facilities (for air filters, CO2 pipelines or injection rigs, among others).”
In addition, standard property insurance can protect technology infrastructure and natural assets like forests against natural disasters, the report added. “More challenging are potential long-term liability exposures arising from the risk of carbon storage reversal.”
Storage Reversal Risks
Carbon removal solutions come with the risk of storage reversal.
Examples of storage reversal events include a wildfire destroying an afforestation project, the new owner of a farm abandoning carbon sequestering land-use practices, and a geological storage reservoir leaking through an old, insufficiently plugged well, according to Swiss Re Institute’s July 2021 report, “The insurance rationale for carbon removal solutions.”
