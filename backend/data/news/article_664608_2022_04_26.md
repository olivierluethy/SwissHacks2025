Upward premium rate momentum is expected to continue support underlying performance for the London market, despite mounting challenges connected to climate modeling, claims inflation and the war in Ukraine, according to AM Best.
“London market re/insurers have enjoyed several consecutive years of rate increases, with every class of business showing positive momentum,” said AM Best in a report titled “Market Segment Outlook: London Market Insurance.”
As a result of the tailwinds benefiting the market, the ratings agency has maintained a “stable” outlook. However, it warns that there are a group of factors that are moderating the positives.
In the positive column is the fact that attritional loss ratios across the London market have improved in recent years as a result of the continuing upward premium rate momentum and the ongoing scrutiny by Lloyd’s to manage syndicates’ performance, the report indicated.
“The current rate hardening continues to be led by the insurance sector rather than by reinsurers, and follows a prolonged soft phase of the cycle during which performance across the London market was generally unsatisfactory.”
Rate hikes in the London market vary by line of business but have generally averaged in the low double digits, the report added.
Cyber, which has seen higher increases, is the “standout exception.”
“Unsurprisingly, rate movements have been strongest for classes which are potentially most impacted by rising economic and social claims inflation, as well as those that have recently experienced sizeable losses,” the report said. “Nevertheless, there continues to be some uncertainty as to whether rate increases are sufficient to offset claims inflation and rising catastrophe losses.”
AM Best explained that a material portion of London market premiums are from reinsurance business, which saw pricing improvements for most lines of business, although at a slower pace than in recent years. “Following the relatively high catastrophe activity in 2021, most notably the floods in Europe and Hurricane Ida in the United States, rate strengthening was strongest in property classes.”
In the report, AM Best described the London market as a hub for internationally traded re/insurance business, encompassing Lloyd’s syndicates and non-Lloyd’s specialty re/insurers, which focus on commercial and specialty business with some geographical bias towards North America, although business is written globally.
