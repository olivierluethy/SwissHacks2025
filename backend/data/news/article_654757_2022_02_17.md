Britainâ€™s Met Office issued a rare red weather warning for parts of the UK, saying hurricane-strength gusts of 90 miles (145 kilometers) an hour are set to hit the country on Friday.
The weather service said the most dangerous winds are likely to affect the southwest coast with damaging gusts expected inland too. The Energy Networks Association is advising people to prepare for possible blackouts by charging their phones and keeping a torch ready.
