NFP, an Aon company and international insurance brokerage and consulting firm, announced it has acquired HELPGB, a human resources and health and safety consulting business.
Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.
Clark Hunter, director of HELPGB, will remain in the business while Dave Townsend, managing director, and Karen Townsend, company secretary, will retire following the acquisition.
As part of NFP, HELPGB clients will now have access to more global resources to support the navigation of the complex HR and health and safety landscape, NFP said.

“We’re delighted to welcome Clark and the talented HELPGB team, while gaining from the depth of knowledge they will bring to our specialty HR and health and safety solutions business,” said Matt Pawley, president of NFP in Europe. “We also wish Dave and Karen all the best in their retirement as we look to build on the brilliant reputation they’ve earned alongside Clark over the years.”
“I am very grateful to the staff and clients who have helped make this twenty-one-year adventure so special, and I could not be handing over the reins to a better company,” said Townsend. “NFP’s values align with those of our company: people and clients come first. I know I can now enjoy my retirement with the assurance that what I helped build is in very safe hands.”
