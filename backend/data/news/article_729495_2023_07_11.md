Some 11,300 claims for damages from riots in France had been filed as of July 7 for a total cost of €650 million ($716 million), the insurers federation said in a statement Tuesday.
The number of claims has doubled compared with a July 3 estimate, France Assureurs said. Claims for commercial property account for 55% of the total value while claims for local government property account for 35%.
The nature of the claims is very different from that of the 2005 riots, when vehicle damage and fire accounted for 82% of claims, for a total cost of €204 million, the insurers federation added.
France Assureurs has asked its members to extend to 30 days the claims notification period generally set at five days in insurance contracts.
