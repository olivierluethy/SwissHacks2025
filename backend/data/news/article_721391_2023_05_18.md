Bermuda-based P/C insurer and reinsurer Everest Re Group, Ltd. announced that its shareholders approved a name change to Everest Group, Ltd. and will trade under a new ticker symbol (NYSE: EG).
The change will become effective on July 10, 2023.
“Everest’s new name and stock ticker reflect the evolution of our value proposition, built on five decades of reinsurance leadership and an expanding presence in the global primary insurance market,” said Juan C. Andrade, Everest president and CEO. “In today’s heightened risk environment, our hybrid business model, breadth of global capabilities and outstanding talent are more vital than ever.”
In addition, the company launched a new corporate website.
Aligned with Everest’s refreshed brand unveiled last November, these changes underscore the company’s ongoing diversification efforts, it said.
“At Everest, underwriting opportunity is more than an ideal – it’s the commitment that inspires excellence in everything we do,” Andrade added. “We continue to advance our strategic objectives as ‘One Everest,’ with the discipline, expertise and agility to create lasting value for all our stakeholders.”
