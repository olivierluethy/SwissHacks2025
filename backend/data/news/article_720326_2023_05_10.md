British outsourcing company Capita warned it would take a 15 million pound to 20 million pound ($25 million) hit after its systems were hacked in a cyber incident earlier this year.
Capita, which provides business support services to government and companies, said in a statement on Wednesday the incident had compromised some data from less than 0.1% of its server estate and it was taking steps to recover and secure its systems.
The up to 20 million pound cost of the incident was a result of specialist professional fees plus investment to reinforce its cyber protections.
“Capita is working closely with all appropriate regulatory authorities and with customers, suppliers and colleagues to notify those affected and take any remaining necessary steps to address the incident,” the company said.
The group added that it was trading in line with expectations, and it posted in-year-revenue wins of 449 million pounds over the first four months of the year, up 16% on the same period last year.
