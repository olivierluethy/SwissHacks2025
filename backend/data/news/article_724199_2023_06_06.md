Chaucer said Group CEO John Fowle has decided to step down at the end of June.
Fowle has been with Chaucer since 2002 and was appointed CEO in January 2017, having previously served as Chaucer’s chief underwriting officer.
Rob Callan will take on the role of interim Group CEO, in addition to his role as Group CFO, subject to regulatory approval, while the search for John’s successor is underway, Chaucer said.
“The past six years as Group CEO of Chaucer have been hugely fulfilling. I have a great affection for Chaucer and its people,” Fowle said. “I am incredibly proud of the strength of our culture and the results we have delivered together. After 20 years with Chaucer, however, I have decided that it is the right moment in my career to step aside and pursue new opportunities, letting the next leader of Chaucer build on what we have achieved.
“I am happy that I leave the business in great shape, with a fantastically capable senior team, brilliant colleagues, and a very supportive owner in China Re. I wish everyone in Chaucer the very best for the future.”
Paul Jardine, non-executive chair of Chaucer, said Fowle “has been instrumental in driving the successful performance of the business over many years and particularly since Chaucer was acquired by China Re. The business has delivered on the five-year post-acquisition plan, including the doubling in size of the business while delivering market leading results.”
