Initial findings from the flight recorders of a DHL-operated plane that crashed near Vilnius Airport in November have given no indication of “illegal interference”, according to the Lithuanian Justice Ministry.
“The preliminary analysis of the Boeing 737-476 flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, along with evidence gathered at the crash site, found no signs of illegal interference,” the Baltic News Service said Friday, citing a ministry’s statement.
An international team of experts from Spain, Germany and the United States is still investigating the accident, while Lithuania’s prosecutor is looking into potential maintenance or repair violations.
The plane with a four-member crew crashed on Nov. 25, killing a Spanish pilot.
