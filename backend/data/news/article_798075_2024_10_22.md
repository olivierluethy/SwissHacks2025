Japanese watchmaker Casio Computer said on Tuesday it will delay the release of its second-quarter earnings due to the impact of a ransomware attack on its accounting process, to mid-November from Nov. 6.
Casio, known for its “G-Shock” series of watches, announced earlier this month that its servers had been damaged by a ransomware attack that potentially resulted in leakage of some personal information of its employees and business partners.
