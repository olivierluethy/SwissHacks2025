The number of Japanese citizens fell at the fastest clip last year since data collection began in the 1960s, adding pressure on the nation’s social security system and shrinking labor market.
The population of Japanese nationals dropped by more than 861,000 to 121.6 million over the year to January 1, extending a streak of decline to 15 years, according to the ministry of internal affairs on Wednesday. While the foreign population increased 11% to hit 3 million for the first time, it was not enough to make up for the shortfall in Japanese nationals. The overall population shrank by 0.4%.
