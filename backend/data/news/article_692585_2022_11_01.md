Claims for road accidents in the UK jumped by over a fifth (22%) in the week after the clocks went back in 2021, according to analysis of internal data by Tesco Bank Motor Insurance.
The findings are based on a comparison of the number of Tesco claims in the week before the clocks go back, with the week after.
The clocks in the UK changed on Oct. 30, while they will change in the U.S. on Nov. 6.
“The clocks going back plunges evenings into darkness and as drivers adapt to the changed conditions, there is a rise in the number of road accident claims. Journeys like school pick-ups or heading home from work, usually made in the daylight, are now done at dusk or under the glare of headlights,” said Dave Thompson, claims director at Tesco Bank.
“For anyone using the roads, it’s important to take that extra bit of care as the clocks go back and reduce the chances of a collision. Give other road users more space, leave more time for journeys, and make sure you are visible on the roads. Some pre-winter car maintenance is also a good thing to tick off too, before the temperature drops,” he added.
Thompson provided some tips for safe winter driving:
