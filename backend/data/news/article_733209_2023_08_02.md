Consilium, the London-based re/insurance brokerage arm of Aventum Group, has been granted a license by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA).
Consilium’s focus in the region will be in the financial and professional lines, construction and commercial property sectors, drawing on its established expertise in these lines.
“We’re delighted to add the Cayman Islands to our growing list of licensed jurisdictions,” commented James Baird, joint CEO of Consilium. “We look forward to reconnecting with clients in the region and developing new relationships. Thanks must go to CIMA for their support throughout the smooth application process.”
Earlier this year Consilium became licensed in Jersey and was licensed to operate in Guernsey in 2022.  Consilium is a Top 50 broker in the UK with 15 offices globally supporting its brokers and direct clients in a number of specialty lines including financial and professional liability, cyber, commercial property, construction and cedent facultative (FAC) reinsurance.
