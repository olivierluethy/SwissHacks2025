Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded that a changing climate is making the country a more difficult place to live as he declared recent destructive flooding on the east coast a national emergency.
Morrison spoke to reporters as he visited Lismore, in northern New South Wales state, one of the areas worst hit by the natural disaster. Extreme rainfall and flooding has already claimed at least 20 lives across Queensland state and NSW and caused tens of thousands of residents to flee their homes since the downpours began about two weeks ago.
