Global specialty insurance and reinsurance broker BMS reports it has acquired Austbrokers Coast to Coast (C2C), a specialist Australian corporate, business, and retail broker, effective 17 January.
BMS is acquiring C2C in full, with staff and infrastructure transferring into BMS’ existing Australian business.
Based in Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast in Queensland, C2C was founded in 1982 and specializes in transport, construction, hazardous goods, and retail small-to-medium enterprises.
Andrew Godden, chief executive of BMS’ Australian business, said the acquisition “aligns well” with its ongoing expansion within the Australian market.
C2C principal Dale Hansen, who is active in the National Insurance Brokers Association (NIBA), has worked with C2C for more than 16 years. He and his team will join BMS.
The terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.
London-based BMS has 28 locations and more than 800 staff members globally.
