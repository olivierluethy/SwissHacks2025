Guy Carpenter reports that average global and regional property catastrophe rates-on-line decreased during the January 2025 renewals in amounts ranging from 5.3% to 7.2%.
Guy Carpenter defines rate on line (ROL) as the cost of reinsurance based on premium as a percentage of limit. (See related renewal article from Carpenter, published on Dec. 30.)
Compared to 2024, Guy Carpenter said its ROL indices changed as follows during the January 2025 renewals:




Carpenter said each ROL index is a measure of the change in the amount paid for coverage, year-on-year, on a consistent program base. Each index reflects the pricing impact of a growing (or shrinking) exposure base, changes in buying habits and the way risk is measured, as well as changes in market conditions. Unlike risk-adjusted measurements, each index is not dependent on the model or method used to measure the amount of perceived risk in a program, which can vary widely.
Guy Carpenterâ€™s latest global and regional property catastrophe rate on line (ROL) indices were published on its Renewal Resource Center.
