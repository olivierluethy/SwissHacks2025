Howden, the London-based insurance broker, announced the acquisition of Wallace McLean, which further strengthens its local expertise and provides an enhanced platform for its strategic growth plans in New Zealand.
Wallace McLean was founded in 2001 and is a well-established advice-based insurance broking practice based in Auckland, with long-standing corporate clients in New Zealand and internationally. The company delivers integrated, strategic insurance solutions in various specialisms including property, agriculture, shipping and freight operations, bodies corporate, self storage, film and entertainment, retail and distribution, and engineering and professional services.
“We chose to join up with Howden because it offers us international depth and breadth, and allows access to global insurance markets to offset the current New Zealand insurance market conditions. We believe that this strategic partnership will enable us to continue and build on our growth strategies by future-proofing the insurance requirements of our clients,” commented Nigel Wallace, the founder and principal of Wallace McLean.
“This is a very exciting time for Howden in the Pacific, and we are honoured that Wallace McLean has chosen Howden to partner with. Wallace McLean is a highly regarded broker, with a very talented and experienced team, and we are delighted to welcome them into the Howden fold,” said Matt Bacon, CEO Howden Pacific. “This acquisition is another great step forward in our strategy to expand our platform in New Zealand, and continue to offer a choice to clients and talent in this key Pacific market.”
