Italian tycoon Leonardo Del Vecchio is backing a push for a change in leadership at Assicurazioni Generali SpA, saying that a proposed slate of new managers put forward by investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone could free the way for a major deal involving Italy’s largest insurer.
Construction magnate Caltagirone’s strategy for Generali offers “a long-term entrepreneurial vision that doesn’t just look for dividends but also at the need to grow the company,” Del Vecchio, 86, told Bloomberg News. Del Vecchio, the founder of eyewear giant Luxottica, is the insurer’s third-largest investor after investment bank Mediobanca SpA and Caltagirone.
