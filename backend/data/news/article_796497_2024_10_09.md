Munich Re has put its high-net worth managing general agent, GrovesJohnWestrup Private Clients.
“A recent strategic review of our businesses led to the difficult decision that GrovesJohnWestrup Private Clients closed for business on 2 October 2024,” according to a Munich Re Specialty spokesperson. “The run-off is handled in accordance with our contractual and regulatory obligations. Munich Re Specialty continues to focus on its core portfolio of products and solutions concentrating on primary specialty risks.”
In a message posted on LinkedIn, GrovesJohnWestrup Private Clients said it will continue to service all existing policies.
“Current policies can still be managed through our broker portal, and any claims can be made via our claims page until 2nd October 2025,” the company said.
“We’d like to thank our clients, partners, and colleagues for your support and trust over the years.”
