Ukraine has suffered $4.3 billion in damage to farmland, machinery and livestock as a result of Russia’s invasion, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.
About half of the “already immense” destruction from the war comes from pollution caused by mines and unharvested crops, according to a report by authors Roman Neyter, Hryhorii Stolnikovych, and Oleg Nivievskyi. Almost a quarter of the total — $926 million — accounts for damage done to farm machinery due to military activity and occupation, they write.
Russia is using food security as an economic weapon, according to Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and a president of Kyiv School of Economics. “They are trying to take over farmland for people to collaborate,” he said in an interview. “They are moving crops away. They are taking food which otherwise would have been consumed in those areas and they’re moving it to Russian areas.”
