Relm Insurance, the Bermuda-based specialty insurance carrier, announced the release of its Side A Difference in Conditions (DIC) solution.
Relm’s Side A DIC solution was created for clients that have been unable to secure enough limit or consistent terms across their directors and officers liability (D&O) program due to operating in challenging and emerging markets.
This proprietary product goes above and beyond “non-indemnifiable loss,” to offer clients a range of first party expenses, up to two reinstatements, and bankruptcy protection, while filling in critical gaps in their underlying liability coverage, Relm explained.
“We are often asked by our clients and brokering partners to provide additional Side A limit and write back exclusions that have been applied to the underlying coverage by markets who have limited understanding of, or appetite for, innovators,” commented Claire Davey, head of Product Innovation and Emerging Risk at Relm Insurance. “We are proud to underwrite with flexibility and step up to meet these needs with our Side A DIC solution that provides another layer of protection.”
This new offering comes on the heels of recent product launches from Relm, including a Web3 product suite and an employment practices offering, as the firm continues to scale up and expand its product lineup.
Relm Insurance was launched in 2019 to support emerging industries that spur innovation and next generation technologies, aiming to address the scarcity of insurance capacity available to these nascent markets.
