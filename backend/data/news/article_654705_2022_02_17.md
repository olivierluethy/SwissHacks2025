Industrial insurer HDI Global SE has restructured its Asia Pacific operations in a move designed to simplify reporting structures in the region and strengthen its offering for customers and business partners.
The reform of reporting lines brings HDI Global’s operations in Hong Kong and Singapore into closer alignment, with the existing management now reporting into Stefan Feldmann who has been appointed to the new position of head of HDI Global Asia Pacific, in addition to his existing role as managing director of HDI Global SE, Australia.
Daniel Lau is managing director Hong Kong, and Graham Silton is managing director Singapore.
The move brings the important operations in Hong Kong and Singapore under a new regional Asia Pacific leadership structure together with HDI Global SE, Australia.
“Bringing our independently successful operating branches in Hong Kong and Singapore closer together will enable us to offer the very best of HDI Global to the insurance markets in Asia Pacific,” commented Stefan Feldmann, head of HDI Global Asia Pacific and managing director of HDI Global SE, Australia.
“HDI Global is committed to the Asia Pacific region, and I am very pleased that this more simplified reporting structure will mean we will be able to service our clients, ceding companies and brokers even better in this important region for our group,” said Jens Wohlthat, member of the HDI Global Executive Board, responsible for Asia, Africa and Russia.
Part of the Industrial Lines Division of the Talanx Group, HDI Global SE has a prominent position in the German and broader European market as well as operations in more than 150 countries through foreign branch offices, subsidiary and peer companies, and network partners.
