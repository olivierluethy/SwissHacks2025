Finance workers are pushing for simpler rules for cross-border remote working, the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled appetite for flexible work isn’t abating.
The UK government, which launched a review into cross-border working rules earlier this year, should adopt common standards around tax, immigration policies and regulatory oversight, according to a report by the City of London Corporation and consulting firm EY published Wednesday.
Cross-border remote working has risen sharply since the pandemic with 75% of UK businesses surveyed now considering it a “medium-to-high priority” to attract and retain talent. The report was based on a survey of 151 respondents across the financial and professional services industry, including representatives from high-street banks, technology companies, law firms and insurers.
“The risk of doing nothing is potentially significant and could lead to a reduction of the UK’s competitiveness on the international stage when it comes to attracting and retaining top global financial talent,” said Seema Farazi, UK financial services immigration partner at EY.
