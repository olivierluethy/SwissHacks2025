Yum! Brands, Inc. on Wednesday announced that a ransomware attack affected certain information technology systems. Almost 300 of its restaurants in the United Kingdom were closed for one day, but the company said all stores are now operational.
Although data was taken from the companyâ€™s network, the company said on Wednesday there was no evidence that customer databases were stolen.
The company said that it initiated response protocols promptly upon detection of the incident, including taking certain systems offline and implementing enhanced monitoring technology.
The company said it also initiated an investigation and hired cybersecurity and forensics professionals, and notified federal law enforcement.
The company said it could take a few days to fully restore all affected systems.
The company said it is not aware of any other restaurant disruptions and does not expect this event to have a material adverse impact on its business, operations or financial results.
Yum! Brands is based in Louisville, Kentucky, and its subsidiaries franchise or operate more than 53,000 restaurants in 155 countries and territories. Its brands include KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Birger Grill.
