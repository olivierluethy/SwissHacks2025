Coalition, the San Francisco-based cyber managing general agent and cyber-security firm, has appointed Tine Simonsen as the company’s head of Insurance for Continental Europe. As an experienced cyber underwriter and broking leader, Simonsen will anchor Coalition’s presence and expansion in the European region.
Simonsen has worked as a specialist within the financial lines and cyber-insurance area for nearly 14 years, focusing on products such as cyber Insurance, D&O insurance, and professional indemnity. In her previous role at AIG, Simonsen led the Nordic financial lines team and managed the financial lines portfolio as the largest profit center for AIG in the Nordics. Before joining AIG, she worked 10 years as a specialist broker for Willis Towers Watson, where she held various positions, the latest being the cyber growth leader for Northern Europe.
“Throughout her years in specialized insurance, Tine has attained valuable insights into European market strategy, making her the best person to spearhead the expansion of Coalition’s Active Insurance across Europe,” said Kyle Bryant, Coalition’s head of International. “It’s important to us to have someone centrally located with such a deep understanding of the insurance industry, and we’re thrilled that Tine has joined to help us expand upon our ability to protect the unprotected globally.”
