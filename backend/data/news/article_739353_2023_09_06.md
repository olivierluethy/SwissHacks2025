The Reinsurance Association of America (RAA) on Wednesday said its long-time president, Frank Nutter, will retire at the end of the year and Lee Covington is president-elect.
Nutter has been president of the trade association for property/casualty reinsurers for 32 years.
“Over the last four decades, Frank has grown the RAA into the leading voice for the reinsurance industry in the United States,” said Justin O’Keefe, chair of RAA’s Board of Directors “Guided by Frank’s leadership, integrity, and vision, the RAA team has addressed some of our industry’s most complex issues at both a federal and state level. On behalf of the RAA Membership, Board of Directors and staff I would like to thank Frank for his unwavering commitment to the RAA and wish him and his family a happy retirement.”
Covington is currently president and CEO of The Surety & Fidelity Association of America (SFAA), a role he has held since 2018. He will take over as RAA president on Jan. 1. Prior to SFAA, Covington was senior vice president of government affairs and general counsel for the Insured Retirement Institute. He has also held positions at Squire Patton Boggs, PWC, Director of the Ohio Department of Insurance, and Deputy Director of the Arkansas Insurance Department.
O’Keefe said Covington is “an immensely qualified leader and his deep expertise and extensive career in insurance industry advocacy and regulation will be invaluable to the RAA.”
