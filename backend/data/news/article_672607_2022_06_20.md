Russia’s state-run Sovcomflot has insured all its cargo ships with Russian insurers and the cover meets international rules, the chief executive said, after Western insurers withdrew cover.
Western insurers halted insurance cover for Russia’s biggest shipping group when Sovcomflot was hit by sanctions after Moscow sent troops across the border into Ukraine.
Sources told Reuters this month that state-controlled Russian National Reinsurance Co. had become the main reinsurer of Russian ships, including Sovcomflot’s fleet.
