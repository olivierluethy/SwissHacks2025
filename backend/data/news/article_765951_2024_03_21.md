At least nine people were killed when a South Korean-flagged vessel capsized off Japan, South Koreaâ€™s foreign ministry said on Thursday.
Two South Korean nationals were among the dead, it said, adding that the Japanese coastguard had rescued an Indonesian crew member and that another member of the crew of 11 was missing.
The ministry did not provide the name of the vessel.
Public broadcaster NHK, citing the coastguard, reported on Wednesday that a South Korean-flagged chemical tanker had capsized off the coast of Yamaguchi prefecture in western Japan, and said seven deaths had been confirmed among the crew of 11.

The tanker, Keoyoung Sun, had been anchored because of bad weather and requested assistance after 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday (2200 GMT on Tuesday), saying it was tilting over, NHK reported.
The tanker was carrying 980 tonnes of acrylic acid, but no spillage has been detected, NHK said.
