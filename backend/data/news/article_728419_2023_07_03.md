Fusion Specialty Europe announces the launch of its Southern Europe branch in Madrid, and the appointment of Filippo Cibin as partner, effective immediately.
Cibin will lead the expansion of Fusion into Southern European, as part of its continued growth strategy across European insurance markets.
Cibin has exceptional experience in the region, having worked in Spain, Italy and Germany, underwriting across a range of M&A and financial lines insurance products for top-tier managing general agencies and global company market insurers, said Fusion in a statement.
He joins Fusion from Howden’s MGA DUAL, where he worked for more than five years, specializing in M&A insurance, according to his LinkedIn profile.
His appointment will further strengthen Fusion’s ability to provide local, cross-continental and innovative insurance solutions primarily for small to mid-market M&A transactions, including its M&A Tech solution: Mio™ (M&A Insurance Online for M&A and Real Estate transactions), the company said.
“I am honoured to join Fusion,” said Cibin. “Having the opportunity to lead the expansion of Fusion’s business into the vibrant Southern European market is incredibly exciting. I look forward to leveraging my expertise and network to build strong partnerships, deliver exceptional solutions, and to drive success for Fusion’s colleagues, brokers and partners.”
