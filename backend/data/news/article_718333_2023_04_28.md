Canopius Group, the London-based global specialty re/insurer, has had a management shake-up, with three executives exiting the company.
“Over the last 18 months, Canopius has reorganised our global underwriting operations to both enhance the focus on specialist underwriting capabilities and enable our three business regions to reach their greatest potential,” the company said in a statement.
“As part of the ongoing strategic transformation, we have agreed that Charles Craigs, Bernie De Haldevang and Rachel Sabbarton will be stepping down from their roles as group head of Reinsurance, Specialty and Short Tail, respectively, and will be leaving the business. They have made a tremendous contribution to Canopius, for which they have our sincere gratitude, and we wish them continued success in their future roles,” the statement continued.
“Our commitment to each of our global products remains unwavering. In the interim, responsibilities will be assumed by our acting Group Chief Underwriting Officer Lisa Davis, and regional Chief Underwriting Officers Alois Rouffiac, Coleman Johnson and Yann Marmonier. We’re also excited to soon welcome Sam Harrison as our group CUO,” the company said.
“We will continue to work hard to achieve the ambitious goals we have set ourselves for this year and beyond and we look forward to realising the increasing benefits afforded by our new operating model and strategic approach.”
