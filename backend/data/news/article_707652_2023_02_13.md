Liberty Mutual Insurance announced the formation of a Global Risk Solutions (GRS) Global Cyber Office and the appointment of a leadership team consisting of industry experts.
The office aims to build and scale Liberty Mutual’s cyber capabilities around the world, bringing a multi-disciplinary approach to a complex risk that spans geographies and industries.
GRS Insurance Solutions President Liz Geary leads the office pending the appointment of a global head of cyber, who will report to her.
“Cyber is among the most complex risks facing companies,” said Geary. “And it is that very complexity that lets us add true value to risk managers and brokers. Our newly created office and leaders align and elevate our expertise in cyber underwriting, product, claims, and risk prevention and mitigation to provide a global platform helping companies better address this critical risk.”
Appointments to Liberty Mutual’s new Global Cyber Office leadership team include:
The launch of the Global Cyber Office and the appointments of key leaders are the latest investment within the GRS Office of Underwriting, which was formed in 2022 to drive results through underwriting excellence, consistent global product strategies and a common view of risk. Since joining the Office of Underwriting in 2022, Geary has focused on building her Insurance Solutions leadership team, charged with providing global support to new and rapidly evolving risks in the market.
