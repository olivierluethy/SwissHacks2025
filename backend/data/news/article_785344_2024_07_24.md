The Connect Group announced the launch of a London-based specialty reinsurer, Stability Re.
This follows the formation in September 2023 of Stability Risk, an MGA created to allow Connect Underwriting Ltd. (a specialist reinsurance MGA) to focus on its core business lines of excess of loss, property, energy and war & terrorism.
Stability Re will provide binder capacity to Stability Risk and underwrite specialty and casualty lines such as directors & officers liability, public & product liability, professional indemnity, contingency and cyber.
“I am thrilled to announce the launch of Stability Re. Alongside existing capacities within the Lloyd’s and London Market, Stability Re will make additional capacity available to Stability Risk and also potentially other partner MGAs,” commented Jamil Elbahou, Connect Group CEO and CUO, in a statement.
ConnectUW Holdings Ltd. is the parent company of the Connect Underwriting group of businesses in the United Kingdom.
