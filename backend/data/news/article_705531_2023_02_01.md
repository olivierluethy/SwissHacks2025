Lloyd’s of London will hand some staff an extra £1,500 ($1,850) to cover rising living costs as inflation persists into 2023.
The insurance exchange told staff Tuesday that those earning less than £75,000 would receive the one-time contribution, according to a spokesperson.
The move comes after Lloyd’s gave the same staff an extra £2,500 last year as soaring energy bills and food prices created a cost-of-living crisis. Other firms including HSBC Holdings Plc, NatWest Group Plc and Barclays Plc have made similar gestures.
