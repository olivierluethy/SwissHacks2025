While no one directly asked the question of this article’s headline at the S&P Global Ratings June annual insurance conference, the prospect that an outlook change is near came into view during the industry meeting.
During a panel on property/casualty sector trends moderated by John Iten, senior director and P/C Insurance Sector Lead, Iten asked Associate Director Saurabh Khasnis to explain why S&P has a negative outlook on the global reinsurance—a stance that the rating agency has maintained since May 2020.
“Although we have our view on the sector as negative, we think that the tipping point is coming sooner for a more stable view,” Khasnis said. “We could revise our view on the sector if the reinsurers maintain discipline in pricing and underwriting,” he added, after explaining that a key reason for the negative outlook was the downward pressure that catastrophe losses have had on earnings and the failure of reinsurers to boost contract prices enough to overcome that impact until recently.

Repricing Is Not Reunderwriting
“The industry’s profitability has been below par for the last several years,” he said, noting that losses from the pandemic, Russia-Ukraine loss exposure, loss creep and volatile investment returns all contributed to the fact that reinsurers “failed to earn their cost of capital in five out of the last six years.”
“I’m stressing the catastrophe losses because of impact [they] had on the earnings not just for one or two years. We have seen that for the past six years,” said S&P’s Saurabh Khasnis.
