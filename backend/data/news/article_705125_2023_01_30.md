A new excess layer cyber facility, called CyXS, was launched by WTW, providing excess layer cyber capacity for global clients.
Key elements of the facility include:
“Our most recent Directors Liability Survey, in partnership with Clyde & Co, highlighted that cyber risks continue to be a top priority for organizations across the globe,” commented Glyn Thoms, head of GB Finex, Cyber and TMT, WTW.
“For the last 12-18 months, the ransomware crisis has made obtaining cyber insurance capacity very difficult yet demand from companies has continued to grow. As we emerge into a more stable market, CyXS helps us continue to support our clients with accessing significant capacity in an efficient way and further adds to our broad suite of innovative cyber solutions,” Thoms added.
