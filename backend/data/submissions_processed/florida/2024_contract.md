Catastrophe Excess of Loss

Reinsurance Contract

Effective: June 1, 2024

(the "Contract")

entered into by and between

Cedant XYZ

Company XYZ

Company DEF

and any and all companies which are now or hereafter

come under the same ownership or management as

Cedant XYZ

(collectively, the "Company")

and

The Subscribing Reinsurer(s) Identified in the

Interests and Liabilities Agreement(s)

Attached to and Forming Part of This Contract

(the "Reinsurer")

Article 1 - Business Covered

This Contract is to indemnify the Company in respect of the liability that may accrue to the

Company as a result of loss or losses to Policies classified by the Company as Residential

Property insurance and (1) assumed by the Company in connection with the Company's

Takeout Agreements with the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation during the term of this

Contract, or (2) in force on the effective date of this Contract, or written, acquired or renewed

during the term of this Contract by or on behalf of the Company, subject to the terms and

conditions herein contained.

Article 2 - Retention and Limit

A. As respects each excess layer of reinsurance coverage provided by this Contract, the

Company shall be liable in respect of each Loss Occurrence for 100% of the Ultimate Net

Loss, shown as "Ultimate Net Loss Retention" for that excess layer in Schedule A attached

hereto. The Reinsurer shall then be liable in respect of each Loss Occurrence for 100% of

the Ultimate Net Loss over and above the Company's applicable retention for each Loss

Occurrence, subject to a limit of liability to the Reinsurer of the amount, shown as

"Reinsurer's Per Occurrence Limit" for that excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto, for

each Loss Occurrence.

B. The Company shall be permitted to carry underlying reinsurance on its retention hereunder,

recoveries under which shall inure solely to the benefit of the Company and be disregarded

in arriving at the Ultimate Net Loss for the purposes of this Contract.

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

C. As respects Loss Occurrences subject to this Contract, any loss reimbursement

recoverable by the Company under the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), shall

be deducted in determining Ultimate Net Loss under this Contract, subject to the following:

1. The full reimbursement amount due from the FHCF for coverage under the Mandatory

Layer based on statutory limits of coverage as of June 1 shall be deemed recovered

by the Company, whether or not actually received from the FHCF and whether or not

reduced because of the FHCF's inability to pay.

2. Any other FHCF recoveries shall be disregarded for purposes of determining Ultimate

Net Loss subject to this Contract.

3. For purposes of allocating recoveries from the FHCF with respect to each Loss

Occurrence, only amounts recoverable by applying the pay-out and retention multiples

for the FHCF prior to any reduction in retention due to multiple Loss Occurrences in

the same annual period shall be included in calculating the deduction from Ultimate

Net Loss.

4. If the Company's aggregate limit of FHCF reimbursement coverage is exhausted by

losses from multiple Loss Occurrences, and the FHCF does not designate the portion

of said limit allocable to each Loss Occurrence, the FHCF reimbursement received

shall be allocated to each individual Loss Occurrence in the proportion that the

Company's losses in that Loss Occurrence bear to the Company's total losses arising

out of all Loss Occurrences that have exhausted the FHCF coverage.

5. For purposes of loss recoveries under this Contract prior to the final determination of

the Company's retention and limit under the FHCF, FHCF coverage shall be

calculated using the Company's "Projected Payout Multiple" under the FHCF. Upon

determination of the Company's retention and limit under the FHCF, losses will be

adjusted, recognizing any adjustment to the "Projected Payout Multiple" caused by a

change in the Aggregate Mandatory FHCF Premium but disregarding any change due

to a decrease in the statutory limit.

D. It is agreed that two or more Risks shall be involved in the same Loss Occurrence before

any recovery can be made hereunder. The Company shall be the sole judge of what

constitutes one "Risk."

E. Notwithstanding anything stated herein, the liability of the Reinsurer for Ultimate Net Loss

under any excess layer of reinsurance coverage provided by this Contract shall not exceed

either of the following:

1. The amount, shown as "Reinsurer's Per Occurrence Limit" for that excess layer in

Schedule A attached hereto, as respects loss or losses arising out of any one Loss

Occurrence; or

2. The amount, shown as "Reinsurer's Term Limit" for that excess layer in Schedule A

attached hereto, in respect of all Loss Occurrences commencing during the term of

this Contract.

2025, both days inclusive, local standard time at the place where the loss occurs, applying

to Loss Occurrences commencing during the term of this Contract.

B. If this Contract is terminated or expires while a Loss Occurrence covered hereunder is in

progress, it is agreed that, subject to the other conditions of this Contract, the Reinsurer

shall indemnify the Company as if the entire Loss Occurrence had occurred during the term

of this Contract.

Article 4 - Special Termination

at any time by giving written notice to the Subscribing Reinsurer in the event of any of the

following circumstances:

Reinsurer to cease writing business, or the Subscribing Reinsurer is placed under

possession of its assets or control of its operations; or

4. The Subscribing Reinsurer's or the Subscribing Reinsurer's group or holding

company's policyholders' surplus (or the equivalent under the Subscribing Reinsurer's

or the Subscribing Reinsurer's group or holding company's accounting system) as

reported in such financial statements of the Subscribing Reinsurer or the Subscribing

Reinsurer's group or holding company as designated by the Company, has been

reduced by 20.0% or more of the amount thereof at any date during the prior

12-month period (including the period prior to the inception of this Contract); or

merged with, acquired by or controlled by any other entity or individual(s) not

participate on this Contract.

C. Termination shall be effected on a cutoff basis. Upon such termination, the Subscribing

Reinsurer shall remain liable for losses occurring prior to the date of termination; however,

the Subscribing Reinsurer shall have no liability for losses occurring subsequent to the

termination of this Contract. The reinsurance premium due the Subscribing Reinsurer

hereunder shall be pro rated based on the period of the Subscribing Reinsurer's

participation hereon. The Subscribing Reinsurer shall immediately return any excess

reinsurance premium received, and the minimum premium requirements set forth in the

Premium Article shall be waived.

D. Additionally, in the event of any of the circumstances listed in paragraph A of this Article,

the Company shall have the option to commute the Subscribing Reinsurer's liability for

losses on Policies covered by this Contract. In the event the Company and the Subscribing

Reinsurer's liability under such Policies, they shall appoint an actuary and/or appraiser to

assess such liability and shall share equally any expense of the actuary and/or appraiser. If

the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer cannot agree on an actuary and/or appraiser,

the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer each shall nominate three individuals, of

whom the other shall decline two, and the final appointment shall be made by drawing lots.

Payment by the Subscribing Reinsurer of the amount of liability ascertained shall constitute

Subscribing Reinsurer's participation under this Contract.

Article 7 - Premium

A. The Company shall pay the Reinsurer a deposit premium for each excess layer of the

amount, shown as "Deposit Premium" for that excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto,

to be paid in three equal installments due on July 1, 2024, October 1, 2024, and January 1,

2025. The final premium for each layer shall be adjusted in accordance with the adjustment

terms indicated in paragraph B below.

B. The adjusted premium for each excess layer shall be calculated at December 31, 2024

using reported exposure data as of October 1, 2024 to calculate the Average October 1,

2024 PML based upon the following formula:

Total deposit premium for the excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto + ((Average

Final October 1, 2024 PML - Average Initial PML)/ Average Initial PML) \* total deposit

premium for the excess layer).

Should the adjusted premium so calculated be less than the deposit premium for that

excess layer indicated in paragraph A above, the final premium shall be adjusted

accordingly, subject to a 90.0% minimum premium, shown as "Minimum Premium" for that

excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto.

Termination Article, if applicable.

In the event the adjusted premium amount for any excess layer exceeds the sum of any

deposit premium installment payments paid for that excess layer prior to the date of the

Company's report, the amount by which the adjusted premium amount for that excess layer

exceeds the sum of any deposit premium installment payments paid for that excess layer

prior to the date of the Company's report shall be divided by the number of deposit premium

installment payment due dates set forth in paragraph A above remaining as of the date of

the Company's report. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A above and in lieu of

the deposit premium installment payment amounts set forth in paragraph A above, such

amount shall be paid at each of the deposit premium installment payment due dates set

forth in paragraph A above remaining as of the date of the Company's report.

In the event the adjusted premium amount for any excess layer is less than the sum of any

deposit premium installment payments paid for that excess layer prior to the date of the

Company's report, the Reinsurer shall remit such return premium due the Company

promptly.

D. "Average Initial PML" means the average of the 20-year and 100-year Gross Loss return

period times based on March 2024 reinsurance submission renewal data, as calculated by

the Company may be included in the Company's loss occurrence. However, an

individual loss subject to this subparagraph cannot be included in more than one loss

or collectively or in collusion with any individual or corporation or any other organization or

reinsurer(s) or otherwise.

that is not a Runoff Subscribing Reinsurer as of the due date of the claim (as specified in

the Late Payments Article).

E. If a Runoff Subscribing Reinsurer does not raise a query concerning a claim it has not paid

within 30 days of billing, it shall be estopped from denying such claim and must pay

immediately.

Article 16 - Cash Call

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Notice of Loss and Loss Settlements Article, upon the

request of the Company, the Reinsurer shall pay any amount with regard to a loss settlement or

settlements that are scheduled to be made (including any payments projected to be made)

within this Contract. Payments shall be overdue 30 days thereafter except for the first

installment of premium, if applicable, which shall be overdue 60 days from inception or

30 days from final line-signing, whichever the later.

3. As respects a "cash call" made in accordance with the Cash Call Article, payment

shall be deemed due 10 days after the demand for payment is transmitted to the

will accrue on the payment or amount overdue in accordance with paragraph A above,

from the date the demand for payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer.

C. If the information contained in the Company's demand for payment is insufficient or not in

accordance with the conditions of this Contract, then within 30 days the Reinsurer shall

request from the Company all additional information necessary to validate its claim and the

payment due date as defined in paragraph B shall be deemed to be the date upon which

the Reinsurer received the requested additional information. This paragraph is only for the

purpose of establishing when a payment is overdue, and shall not alter the provisions of the

Notice of Loss and Loss Settlements Article or other pertinent contractual stipulations.

out in paragraph B be exceeded, interest as stipulated in paragraph A shall be payable for

the entire overdue period, but only for the amount of the final settlement with the Reinsurer.

E. In the event arbitration is necessary to settle a dispute, the panel shall have the authority to

make a determination awarding interest to the prevailing party. Interest, if any, awarded by

the panel shall supersede the interest amounts outlined herein.

F. Any interest owed pursuant to this Article may be waived by the party to which it is owed.

Waiver of such interest, however, shall not affect the waiving party's rights to other interest

amounts due as a result of this Article.

Article 18 - Offset

A. The Company and the Reinsurer may offset any premium due from one party to

the other under the terms of this Contract.

Broker ABC

24\X

Page 15

**--- PAGE BREAK ---**

However, in the event of the insolvency, administrative supervision, or

receivership of a party hereto, offsets shall be allowed only in accordance with applicable

statutes and regulations. For the purposes of determining the date when a party's

obligation is incurred with regards to liability for premium (including any deposits and

reinstatements) under such statutes and regulations, the Company and the Reinsurer

hereby agree that such date shall be the occurrence of a covered Loss Occurrence

resulting in loss under this Contract.

B. Should the Company go into liquidation or should a receiver be appointed, all amounts due,

or that would become due (including all deposits and reinstatements, net of adjustments, if

any) either the Company or Reinsurer, whether by reason of premium, losses, or otherwise

under this Contract or any other contract heretofore or hereafter entered between the

parties (whether such contract is all assumed or ceded), shall be subject to the right of

offset at any time and from time to time, and upon the exercise of the same, only the net

balance shall be due.

Article 19 - Currency

A. Where the word "Dollars" and/or the sign "$" appear in this Contract, they shall mean

United States Dollars.

currencies other than United States Dollars, such premiums or losses shall be converted

into United States Dollars at the actual rates of exchange at which these premiums or

losses are entered in the Company's books.

Article 20 - Unauthorized Reinsurance

A. This Article applies only to the extent a Subscribing Reinsurer does not qualify for full credit

with any insurance regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company's reserves.

The Company agrees, in respect of its Policies or bonds falling within the scope of this

B.

Contract, that when it files with its insurance regulatory authority, or sets up on its books

liabilities as required by law, it will forward to the Reinsurer a statement showing the

proportion of such liabilities applicable to the Reinsurer. The "Reinsurer's Obligations" shall

be defined as follows:

1. Unearned premium (if applicable);

2. Known outstanding losses that have been reported to the Reinsurer and Loss

Adjustment Expense relating thereto;

3. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense paid by the Company but not recovered from

the Reinsurer;

5. All other amounts for which the Company cannot take credit on its financial statements

unless funding is provided by the unauthorized Reinsurer.

C. The Reinsurer's Obligations shall be funded by funds withheld, cash advances, Trust

Agreement or a Letter of Credit (LOC) to the extent required in order for the Company to

receive full credit for reinsurance ceded to the Reinsurer in accordance with the applicable

law and regulation in the state of the Company's domicile. The Reinsurer shall have the

option of determining the method of funding provided it is acceptable to the insurance

regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company's reserves.

D. When funding by Trust Agreement, the Reinsurer shall ensure that the Trust Agreement

complies with the provisions of the "Trust Agreement Requirements Clause" attached

hereto. When funding by an LOC, the Reinsurer agrees to apply for and secure timely

delivery to the Company of a clean, irrevocable and unconditional LOC issued by a bank

and containing provisions acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities having

jurisdiction over the Company's reserves in an amount equal to the Reinsurer's Obligations

or an amount to the extent required in order for the Company to receive full credit for

reinsurance ceded to the Reinsurer in accordance with the applicable law and regulation in

the state of the Company's domicile. Such LOC shall be issued for a period of not less than

one year, and shall be automatically extended for one year from its date of expiration or any

future expiration date unless 30 days (or such other time period as may be required by

insurance regulatory authorities), prior to any expiration date the issuing bank shall notify

the Company by certified or registered mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the

LOC extended for any additional period.

E. The Reinsurer and the Company agree that any funding provided by the Reinsurer

pursuant to the provisions of this Contract may be drawn upon at any time, notwithstanding

any other provision of this Contract, and be utilized by the Company or any successor, by

operation of law, of the Company including, without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator,

receiver or conservator of the Company, for the following purposes, unless otherwise

provided for in a separate Trust Agreement:

To reimburse the Company for the Reinsurer's Obligations, the payment of which is

1.

due under the terms of this Contract and that has not been otherwise paid;

2. To make refund of any sum that is in excess of the actual amount required to pay the

Reinsurer's Obligations under this Contract (or in excess of 100% of Reinsurer's

Obligations, if funding is provided by a Trust Agreement);

3. To fund an account with the Company for the Reinsurer's Obligations. Such cash

deposit shall be held in an interest bearing account separate from the Company's

other assets, and interest thereon not in excess of the prime rate shall accrue to the

benefit of the Reinsurer. Any taxes payable on accrued interest shall be paid out of

the assets in the account that are in excess of the Reinsurer's Obligations (or in

excess of 100% of Reinsurer's Obligations, if funding is provided by a Trust

Agreement). If the assets are inadequate to pay taxes, any taxes due shall be paid by

the Reinsurer;

4. To pay the Reinsurer's share of any other amounts the Company claims are due

under this Contract.

F. If the amount drawn by the Company is in excess of the actual amount required for E(1) or

E(3), or in the case of E(4), the actual amount determined to be due, the Company shall

promptly return to the Reinsurer the excess amount so drawn. All of the foregoing shall be

applied without diminution because of insolvency on the part of the Company or the

Reinsurer.

G. The issuing bank shall have no responsibility whatsoever in connection with the propriety of

withdrawals made by the Company or the disposition of funds withdrawn, except to ensure

that withdrawals are made only upon the order of properly authorized representatives of the

Company.

H. At annual intervals, or more frequently at the discretion of the Company, but never more

frequently than quarterly, the Company shall prepare a specific statement of the Reinsurer's

Obligations for the sole purpose of amending the LOC or other method of funding, in the

following manner:

1. If the statement shows that the Reinsurer's Obligations exceed the balance of the LOC

as of the statement date, the Reinsurer shall, within 30 days after receipt of the

statement, secure delivery to the Company of an amendment to the LOC increasing

the amount of credit by the amount of such difference. Should another method of

funding be used, the Reinsurer shall, within the time period outlined above, increase

such funding by the amount of such difference.

2. If, however, the statement shows that the Reinsurer's Obligations are less than the

balance of the LOC (or that 100% of the Reinsurer's Obligations are less than the trust

account balance if funding is provided by a Trust Agreement), as of the statement

date, the Company shall, within 30 days after receipt of written request from the

Reinsurer, release such excess credit by agreeing to secure an amendment to the

LOC reducing the amount of credit available by the amount of such excess credit.

Should another method of funding be used, the Company shall, within the time period

outlined above, decrease such funding by the amount of such excess.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, as respects a Reinsurer that is a

I.

Reciprocal Jurisdiction Reinsurer, the Reinsurer agrees to provide collateral for 100% of the

Reinsurer's Obligations under this Contract, if the Reinsurer resists enforcement of a final

judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a

properly enforceable arbitration or arbitral award, whether obtained by the Company or by

its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate, if applicable.

Further, with respect to Certain Underwriting Members of Lloyd's, this Contract does not

constitute an American Reinsurance Policy as defined under the Lloyd's US Situs Credit for

Reinsurance Trust Deed or the Lloyd's American Credit for Reinsurance Joint Asset Trust

Deed. Therefore, the Company does not have recourse to those trust funds with respect to

this Contract.

Article 21 - Taxes

not to claim any deduction of the premium hereon when making tax returns, other than

the District of Columbia.

B. 1. Each Subscribing Reinsurer has agreed to allow, for the purpose of paying the

Federal Excise Tax, the applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as

imposed under the Internal Revenue Code) to the extent such premium is subject to

Federal Excise Tax.

2. In the event of any return of premium becoming due hereunder, the Subscribing

Reinsurer shall deduct the applicable percentage of the premium from the amount of

the return, and the Company or its agent should take steps to recover the Tax from

the U.S. Government.

Article 22 - Access to Records

A. The Reinsurer or its duly authorized representatives shall have the right to visit the offices

of the Company to inspect, examine, audit, and verify any of the Policy, accounting or claim

files ("Records") relating to business reinsured under this Contract during regular business

hours after giving five working days prior notice. This right shall be exercisable during the

term of this Contract or after the termination or expiration of this Contract.

B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Subscribing Reinsurer shall not have any right of access

to the Records of the Company if the Subscribing Reinsurer is not current in all Undisputed

payments due the Company or if any letter of credit or other security instrument required

under the provisions of this Contract is either not in place or deficient in some manner.

"Undisputed" as used herein shall mean any amount that the Subscribing Reinsurer has not

contested in writing to the Company within 30 days after the date the Subscribing Reinsurer

receives notification of the loss, specifying the reason(s) why the payments are disputed.

Article 23 - Confidentiality

A. The Reinsurer hereby acknowledges that the documents, data and other written information

provided to it by the Company, whether directly or through an authorized agent, in

connection with the placement and execution of this Contract ("Confidential Information")

contain proprietary and confidential information of the Company. Confidential Information

shall not include documents, information or data that the Reinsurer can show:

Are publicly known or have become publicly known through no unauthorized act of the

1.

Reinsurer;

2. Have been rightfully received from a third person without obligation of confidentiality;

B. Absent the written consent of the Company, the Reinsurer shall not disclose any

Confidential Information to any third parties, including any affiliated companies not directly

involved in the Company's reinsurance coverage hereunder or the underwriting thereof,

except:

1. When required by retrocessionaires subject to the business ceded to this Contract;

2. When required by regulators performing an audit of the Reinsurer's records and/or

financial condition; or

3. When required by external auditors performing an audit of the Reinsurer's records in

the normal course of business.

C. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the Reinsurer is required by court order, other

legal process (including, without limitation, as may be required by U.S. federal tax law or

regulation) or any regulatory authority to release or disclose any or all of the Confidential

Information, the Reinsurer agrees to provide the Company with written notice of same at

least 10 days, or as soon as practicable after 10 days, prior to such release or disclosure

and to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to assist the Company, at the

Company's expense, in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in this Article. However,

of any arbitration and/or dispute resolution panel, the order of any governmental regulator,

and/or any other law, regulation, or order.

transmission of any Confidential Information to the Reinsurer.

Article 24 - Errors and Omissions

Any inadvertent error, omission or delay in complying with the terms and conditions of this

Contract shall not be held to relieve either party hereto from any liability that would attach to it

hereunder if such error, omission or delay had not been made, provided such error or omission

is rectified immediately upon discovery.

Article 25 - Insolvency

A. This Article shall apply severally to each reinsured company referenced within the definition

of "Company" in this Contract. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary

jurisdiction shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company intended to be

laws of the domiciliary jurisdiction of any company intended to be covered hereunder, that

domiciliary jurisdiction's laws shall prevail.

| B.  | In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance (or the portion of any risk or obligation assumed by the Reinsurer, if required by applicable law) shall be payable directly to the Company, or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, either: (1) on the basis of the liability of the Company, or (2) on the basis of claims filed and allowed in the liquidation proceeding, whichever may be required by applicable statute, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the Policy or bond reinsured, which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the benefit that may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. |

| C.  | Where two or more reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this reinsurance Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| D.  | As to all reinsurance made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective under this Contract, the reinsurance shall be payable as set forth above by the Reinsurer to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, (except as provided by Section 4118(a)(1)(A) of the New York Insurance Law, provided the conditions of 1114(c) of such law have been met, if New York law applies) or except (1) where the Contract specifically provides another payee in the event of the insolvency of the Company, or (2) where the Reinsurer, with the consent of the direct insured or insureds, has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. Then, and in that event only, the Company, with the prior approval of the certificate of assumption on New York risks by the New York Superintendent of Financial Services, or with the prior approval of such other regulatory authority as may be applicable, is entirely released from its obligation and the Reinsurer shall pay any loss directly to payees under such Policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| E.  | Should the Company go into liquidation or should a receiver be appointed, all amounts due, or that would become due (including all deposits and reinstatements, net of adjustments, if any) either the Company or Reinsurer, whether by reason of premium, losses, or otherwise under this Contract, shall be subject to the right of offset, to the extent permitted by applicable Florida law, at any time and from time to time, and upon the exercise of the same, only the net balance shall be due.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Article 26 - Arbitration

A. Any dispute arising out of the interpretation, performance or breach of this Contract,

including the formation or validity thereof, shall be submitted for decision to a panel of three

arbitrators. Notice requesting arbitration shall be in writing and sent certified or registered

mail, return receipt requested.

B. One arbitrator shall be chosen by each party and the two arbitrators shall then choose an

impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. If either party fails to appoint its

arbitrator within 30 days after being requested to do so by the other party, the latter, after

10 days' prior notice by certified or registered mail of its intention to do so, may appoint the

second arbitrator.

C. If the two arbitrators do not agree on a third arbitrator within 60 days of their appointment,

the third arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the procedures for selecting the third

arbitrator in force on the date the arbitration is demanded, established by the AIDA

Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society - U.S. (ARIAS). The arbitrators shall be

persons knowledgeable about insurance and reinsurance who have no personal or financial

interest in the result of the arbitration. If a member of the panel dies, becomes disabled or

is otherwise unwilling or unable to serve, a substitute shall be selected in the same manner

as the departing member was chosen and the arbitration shall continue.

D. Within 30 days after all arbitrators have been appointed, the panel shall meet and

determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules of hearings. The

panel shall therefore make its decision with regard to the custom and usage of the

insurance and reinsurance business. The panel is relieved from all judicial formalities and

may abstain from the strict rules of law. The panel shall make its decision within 60 days

following the termination of the hearings, unless the parties consent to an extension. The

majority decision of the panel shall be final and binding upon all the parties to the

proceeding. Judgment may be entered upon the final decision of the panel in any court of

competent jurisdiction in the State of Florida.

E. The panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict rules

of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, the

arbitrators may at their discretion, consider underwriting and placement information

provided by the Company to the Reinsurer, as well as any correspondence exchanged by

the parties that is related to this Contract. The arbitration shall take place in Location Y,

Florida, or at such other place as the parties shall agree. The decision of any two

arbitrators shall be in writing and shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to

grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate.

F. The panel shall interpret this Contract as an honorable engagement rather than as merely a

legal obligation and shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the

applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible after the hearings.

Judgment upon an award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

G. Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear

with the other party the cost of the third arbitrator. The remaining costs of the arbitration

shall be allocated by the panel. The panel may, at its discretion, award such further costs

and expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, to the

extent permitted by law.

Article 27 - Service of Suit

A. This Article applies only to those Subscribing Reinsurers not domiciled in the United States

of America, and/or not authorized in any state, territory and/or district of the United States of

America where authorization is required by insurance regulatory authorities.

B. This Article shall not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to

arbitrate their disputes as provided for in the Arbitration Article. This Article is intended as

an aid to compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or arbitral award, not as an

alternative to the Arbitration Article for resolving disputes arising out of this Contract.

C. In the event of the failure of the Reinsurer to perform its obligations hereunder, the

Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, shall submit to the jurisdiction of a court of

competent jurisdiction within the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should

be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an action in any

court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States

District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of

the United States or of any state in the United States. The Reinsurer, once the appropriate

court is selected, whether such court is the one originally chosen by the Company and

accepted by the Reinsurer or is determined by removal, transfer, or otherwise, as provided

for above, shall comply with all requirements necessary to give said court jurisdiction and,

in any suit instituted against the Reinsurer upon this Contract, shall abide by the final

decision of such court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.

D. Service of process in such suit may be made upon Company 123, or another party specifically

designated in the applicable Interests and Liabilities Agreement attached hereto. The

above-named are authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of the

Reinsurer in any such suit.

E. Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States that

makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby designates the Superintendent,

Commissioner or Director of Insurance, or other officer specified for that purpose in the

statute, or his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon whom

may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on

behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract, and hereby

designates the above-named as the person to whom the said officer is authorized to mail

such process or a true copy thereof.

Article 28 - Governing Law

This Contract shall be governed as to performance, administration and interpretation by the

laws of the State of Georgia, exclusive of conflict of law rules. However, with respect to credit for

reinsurance, the rules of all applicable states shall apply.

Article 29 - Entire Agreement

A. This Contract sets forth all of the duties and obligations between the Company and the

Reinsurer and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written agreements with

respect to matters referred to in this Contract. This Contract may not be modified or

changed except by an amendment to this Contract in writing signed by both parties.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A above, an amendment to this Contract will

be binding on any Runoff Subscribing Reinsurer if the sum of the percentage shares of

Active Subscribing Reinsurers that have agreed to the amendment exceeds 50.0% of the

sum of the percentage shares of all Active Subscribing Reinsurers. "Active Subscribing

Reinsurer" as used in this Article will mean a Subscribing Reinsurer that is not a Runoff

Subscribing Reinsurer as of the proposed effective date of the amendment.

Article 30 - Non-Waiver

The failure of the Company to insist on compliance with this Contract or to exercise any right,

remedy or option hereunder shall not: (1) constitute a waiver of any rights contained in this

Contract, (2) prevent the Company from thereafter demanding full and complete compliance,

(3) prevent the Company from exercising such remedy in the future, nor (4) affect the validity of

this Contract or any part thereof.

Article 31 - Severability

If any provision of this Contract shall be rendered illegal or unenforceable by the laws,

regulations or public policy of any jurisdiction, regulatory body or court, such provision shall be

considered void in such jurisdiction, but this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any

other provision of this Contract or the enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Article 32 - Assignment and Assumption

A. The Reinsurer must provide the Company with at least 90 days notice of any intent to have

its obligations and/or duties under this Contract assigned to or assumed by another

reinsurer or another entity.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A above, the obligations and/or duties of the

Reinsurer under this Contract shall not be assigned to or assumed by another reinsurer or

another entity without the prior written consent of the Company.

Article 33 - Agency Agreement (BRMA 73A)

If more than one reinsured company is named as a party to this Contract, the first named

company shall be deemed the agent of the other reinsured companies for purposes of sending

or receiving notices required by the terms and conditions of this Contract, and for purposes of

remitting or receiving any monies due any party.
