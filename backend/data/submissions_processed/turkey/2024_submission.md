Türkiye's economy has begun to stabilise driven by changes in monetary policy after a period Company ABC

of economic uncertainty

Following changes within the Central Bank and

Finance ministry in March, Türkiye has begun to take a

different economic course

Measures to tighten monetary policy, control inflation

and sustain real term economic growth to sustain TRY

On an annualised basis the changes will take time to

fully materialise, however, the disinflation process that

started in June is projected to continue with a stronger

In 2024, TRY to EUR exchange rate has largely

After a series of interest rate increases, the Turkish

Central Bank estimates the rate of inflation will

fall to 14% for year-end 2025

Whilst there are uncertainties around potential legislative changes (e.g. inclusion of contents and/or

additional perils), Company ABC reinsurance contract will continue to provide cover for residential properties and EQ

only for 2024/25

Compulsory Earthquake Insurance is an insurance system that developed for residential buildings within the

municipality's borders pursuant to Disaster Insurances Law no. 6305.

Company ABC indemnifies for material damages caused by earthquakes and the fires, explosions, tsunami and

landslide that are caused directly by the earthquake within the limits stated in the Company ABC policy.

The building parts which are mentioned below are covered collectively or separately:

Foundations, Main walls, Common walls separating the independent sections, Garden walls, Retaining

-

walls, Ceilings and basements, Stairs, Elevators, Platforms, Corridors, Roofs, Chimneys, Supplementary

sections of the building which have similar qualities to those mentioned above

The indemnity amount of the insured is determined according to the size and the building style of the

dwellings on condition that it does not exceed the maximum sum insured

2023/24 period: compounding of doubling policy limit plus monthly indexation 2024/25 period: monthly indexation only

The government doubled Company ABC limits from TRY1 to TRY2 from 1st January 2024, which was further indexed on a monthly basis

For 2024, there has been a one-off compounding effect that has exacerbated limit increases; this has partly driven the significant exposure

growth in 2023/24

From 2025 onwards, this impact will be limited to monthly inflation tracking Turkish Producer Price Index (PPI) is being used as the

indexation factor so that policy limits are adjusted accordingly throughout the policy period (Construction Cost Index is not updated on a

regular basis)

As the example demonstrates, with only inflation impacting policy limits this leads to stabilisation in the following contract period

Court judgement

The Court final legal precedent found in favour of Company ABC resulting in a reduction in

required Outstanding claims reserves

The Court concluded that Company ABC's liability is limited to the insurance amount stated in

policy and no double limit would be applied

The court has now dismissed the appeal objections and upheld the previous decision, confirming that the Company ABC had

fulfilled its responsibilities as per the policy and legal regulations

Appendix B: Modelling

Details

The recent earthquake, raised concerns about how well industry-standard models capture seismic risks in region in question.
In some areas, such as Region A, predicted shaking intensities aligned well with observed data.
However, in Region B, significant underestimation occurred due to the Valley Amplification Effect, which was not accounted for in the model.
Underestimation of Potential Losses

Discrepancies in ground movement predictions directly impact damage estimates.
For example, a high-rise steel-frame building was initially forecasted to experience a 50% Mean Damage Ratio (MDR) at 0.9g PGA, but actual ground acceleration of 1.4g PGA resulted in an MDR of 78%, meaning loss expectations were significantly understated.

Unpriced Risk in Certain Areas

Areas where seismic activity has been underestimated may have inadequate insurance coverage or mispriced policies, leading to unexpected financial exposure.
However, regions such as Metropolitan X, where amplification effects are less pronounced, may not face the same risk adjustments.
Adjustments to Risk Models

Industry assessments revealed that damage vulnerability curves in the model may be understated, particularly at moderate intensity levels where partial structural failures occur.
Comparing the model with Y's seismic research showed a higher vulnerability index, prompting an updated risk framework for 2025.
