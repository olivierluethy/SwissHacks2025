This Agreement shall only protect that portion of any insurance or reinsurance which the Reinsured, acting

in accordance with its established practices, retains net for its own account. The amount of the Reinsurers'

liability hereunder in respect of any loss or losses shall not be increased due to an error or omission which

results in an increase in the Reinsured's normal net retention nor by the Reinsured's failure to reinsure in

accordance with its established practice, nor by reason of the inability of the Reinsured to collect from any

other reinsurers (whether specific or general) any amounts which may have become due from them whether

such inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurers or otherwise.

ARTICLE 8

CLAIM NOTIFICATION AND CASH ADVANCE CLAUSE

provided that the estimated loss amount exceeds the attachment level of the impacted layer(s) by 20%.

3. The Cash Advance payment shall be allocated to the individual layer(s) of this reinsurance contract in the

same manner as a loss payment would be allocated, i.e. loss payment(s) in excess of the Cash Advance of

by claims payments.

The Cash Advance shall be payable by Reinsurers upon receipt of the Reinsured's Initial Loss Estimate

within fourteen working (14) days and shall be subject to the agreement of the Contract Leader.

4. In the event that the total of all advance payments made by the Reinsurer(s) exceeds the amount of the

final amount of Ultimate Net Loss in excess of the underlying loss hereon, then the Reinsured shall

reimburse the Reinsurer for the amount of the over payment of the loss settlement made by them

hereunder.

Such reimbursement shall be effected by the Reinsured within sixty days of the date that the amount of

AMENDMENTS AND ALTERATIONS CLAUSE

It is hereby understood and agreed that any amendments and/or alterations to this Agreement that are

mutually agreed either by correspondence and/or Brokers' Endorsement(s) shall be automatically binding

hereon and shall be considered as forming an integral part hereof.

ARTICLE 19

SPECIAL EXTENSION

Should a catastrophic event (as defined below) occur during the last month of this Agreement

1. (a)

and should negotiations necessary to effect the renewal of this Agreement have not been

concluded the period of this Agreement shall be automatically extended for a period of one

month, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 below.

(b) If negotiations necessary to effect the renewal of this Agreement have not been concluded by

the end of the one-month extension period provided for above then this Agreement shall be

extended for a further period of one month.

(c) If at the end of the further one-month extension period provided for in 1. (b) above negotiations

necessary to effect the renewal of this Agreement have still not been concluded then this

Agreement shall be extended for a third period of one month, after which there will be no further

extension without the express agreement of the parties.

This Agreement will not be extended as provided for in paragraphs 1. (a), (b) or (c) above if the

2.

Reinsured notifies the Reinsurers that an extension, or further extension, is not required, which the

Reinsured will do without unreasonable delay if they are satisfied that the catastrophic event does not

interrupt communications between the parties and does not affect their ability to access and transmit

data necessary to negotiate renewal of this Agreement, or if such circumstances, having existed, cease

to exist.

3. (a) As consideration for any extension under this clause there will be an additional premium which

shall be calculated at daily pro rata of the annual premium for this Agreement and added to the

premium for the original 12 month period for this Agreement.

Any reinstatement premium will be calculated on 100% of the annual premium for the original

(b)

12 month period of this Agreement, and calculated pro-rata as to the fraction of the limit of

liability reinstated.

4. (a) For the purposes of this clause, a catastrophic event shall be considered by the Reinsured to be

circumstances where the Reinsured has no regular or reliable means of external communication

or any reasonable access to office systems and data and is therefore prevented from engaging in

their normal renewal exchanges.

(b) A month is defined as a calendar month.

ARTICLE 20

SPECIAL TERMINATION CLAUSE

Section 1 (Special right of cancellation in the event of a downgrading of security ratings)

(a) It is a condition upon each subscribing Reinsurer who participates in this Agreement that such

individual subscribing Reinsurer shall at all times during the period of this Agreement maintain an

insurer financial strength (IFS) rating from Standard & Poor's Rating Group of 55 Water Street, New

York, New York 10041, USA (S&P) of "BBB+" or superior to "BBB+".

(b) In the event of an explicit downgrading of any individual subscribing Reinsurer by S&P to an IFS

rating inferior to "BBB+", then, at the sole option of the Reinsured, the Reinsured may elect to

terminate the participation of that subscribing Reinsurer by giving notice to that Reinsurer. The

effective date of such termination shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Reinsured provided

the date SO determined shall not be earlier than the date upon which the relevant downgrading by S&P

was announced in New York, USA nor earlier than the date the Reinsurer is advised that the Reinsured

intends to invoke their downgrading rights.

(c) Any individual subscribing Reinsurer who does not have an IFS rating from S&P but maintains during

the period of this Agreement a "B++" or superior to "B++" rating from A.M. Best Company of

Ambest Road, Oldwick, New Jersey 08858-0700 USA (Best) shall also be considered as falling

within the terms of this Article. Any explicit downgrading of such an individual subscribing Reinsurer

by Best to a rating less than "B++" shall give the Reinsured the same right of termination as set out

in (b) above.

(d) In the event that a rating should be given to an individual subscribing Reinsurer by both S&P and

Best then the rating of S&P shall prevail.

(e) If a Reinsurer does not have an IFS rating from either S&P or Bests, and in the judgment of the

Reinsured the security of the Reinsurer has materially deteriorated since inception of this Contract,

the Reinsured may elect to cancel the participation of that Reinsurer within 60 days of becoming

aware of such deterioration.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt the status of CreditWatch as defined by S&P or a rating modifier of 'u'

(Under Review) applied to a rated Company as defined by Best shall not, of itself, be construed as a

downgrading for the purposes of this Agreement.

With regard to any Lloyd's Underwriters participating hereunder the rating applicable to each

(g)

individual Lloyd's Underwriter shall be the S&P IFS rating applicable to the Lloyd's Insurance

Market as a whole at the time the leading Lloyd's Underwriter contracted in writing to participate in

this Agreement.

Section 2 (Termination)

Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving the other party notice:

if the performance of the whole or any part of this Agreement is prohibited or rendered impossible de

a.

jure or de facto in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the preceding words in

consequence of any law or regulation which is or shall be in force in any country or territory or if any

law or regulation shall prevent directly or indirectly the remittance of any payments due to or from

either party,

b. if the other party has become insolvent or unable to pay its debts or has lost the whole or 25% or more

of its paid-up capital or has had any authority to transact any class of insurance withdrawn, suspended

or made conditional,

C. if the country or territory in which the other party resides or has its head office or is incorporated shall

be involved in armed hostilities with the country of the first party whether war be declared or not, or

is partly or wholly occupied by the country of the first party or be in a state of civil war,

d. if either party shall have failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Contract

hereunder, the innocent party must give notice to the defaulting party of the alleged default with a

permitted and reasonable time to rectify the alleged default. The innocent party shall have the right

to cancel this Contract if the defaulting party does not comply with this notice.

Section 3 (Effect)

After the date of termination (which cannot be prior to notification of the event by the terminating party to

the other), under either Sections 1 or 2 above, the liability of the Reinsurer hereunder shall cease outright

other than in respect of losses which have occurred or commenced prior thereto. Liability for losses in

progress at the date of termination is dealt with in accordance with Item No: 2 of the PERIOD Article.

Either party affected by any of the above mentioned events shall notify the other party in writing within

thirty days after its occurrence, unless such event is obviously known by the other party.

All notices of termination served in accordance with any of the provisions of Sections 1 or 2 above shall be

by email, facsimile, or any other means of instantaneous communication that provides permanent record of

such communication within thirty days after obtaining knowledge of any of the above mentioned events

and shall be deemed to be served upon dispatch or where communications between the parties are

interrupted upon attempted dispatch.

All notices of termination served in accordance with any of the provisions of Sections 1 or 2 above shall be

addressed to the party concerned at its head office or at any other address previously designated by that

party.

In the event of termination in accordance with the provisions of Sections 1 or 2 above the exact premium

payable hereunder shall be calculated pro rata temporis of the Premium as specified under PREMIUM in

the attached Risk Details up to the date of termination or pro rata temporis of the Minimum Premium,

whichever is greater. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any reinstatement premium that may be payable shall

be based upon the full annual premium calculated in accordance with the provisions of the PREMIUM

article.

Following the termination, the Parties may agree upon a mutually acceptable commutation of any or all of

the outstanding liabilities under this Contract and any predecessor Contract. In the event the Reinsured and

the Reinsurers do not agree to a mutually acceptable commutation, the parties respective rights and

obligations shall continue as set forth in this Contract

and may receive and act upon such evidence whether oral or written strictly admissible or not as it

shall in its discretion think fit.

6. The Appointor shall be as specified under Appointor in the attached Risk Details or if he is

unavailable or it is inappropriate for him to act for any reason, such person as may be nominated by

the Committee of that body. If for any reason such persons decline or are unable to act then the

appointor shall be the judge of the appropriate Courts having jurisdiction at the place of Arbitration.

All costs of the arbitration shall be at the discretion of the arbitration tribunal who may direct to and

7.

by whom and in what manner they shall be paid.

a.

b. The award of the arbitration tribunal shall be in writing and not binding upon the parties who

SECURITY DETAILS

REINSURERS'

LIABILITY:

(Re)insurer's liability several

The liability of a insurer under this Contract is joint with other

re)insurers party to this Contract. A (re)insurer is jointly liable for the proportion of

liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer.

The proportion of liability under this Contract underwritten by a (re) insurer (or, in

the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the

members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject

always to the provision concerning "signing" below.

In the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the

syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the

total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions

underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of

each member of the syndicate is joint with other members. A member is jointly liable

for any other member's proportion. The business

address of each member is Lloyd's, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The

identity of each member of a Lloyd's syndicate and their respective proportion may

be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd's, at the above address.

Proportion of liability

Unless there is "signing" (see below), the proportion of liability under this Contract

underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of

the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is

shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its "written line".

Where this Contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted

("signed"). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this Contract to show the

definitive proportion of liability under this Contract underwritten by each

(re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions

underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive

proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions

underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd's syndicate taken together) is referred

to as a "signed line". The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the

written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.

Although reference is made at various points in this clause to "this Contract" in

the singular, where the circumstances SO require this should be read as a reference

to Contracts in the plural

ORDER HEREON: (To be completed by Broker X and Company Limited when advised by the

Client):

| Layer 1: | % of 100% |
| -------- | --------- |
| Layer 2: | % of 100% |
| Layer 3: | % of 100% |

| BASIS OF WRITTEN LINES: | Percentage of Whole.   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| BASIS OF SIGNED LINES:  | Percentage of Whole.   |
| SIGNING PROVISIONS:     | Disproportionate Lines |

In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written

"to stand" will be allocated in full and all other lines will be signed down in equal

proportions SO that the aggregate signed lines are equal to 100% of the order without

further agreement of any of the Reinsurers.

However:

a) in the event that the placement of the order is not completed by the

commencement date of the period of reinsurance then all lines written by that

date will be signed in full;

b) the Reinsured may elect for the disproportionate signing of Reinsurers' lines,

without further specific agreement of Reinsurers, providing that any such

variation is made prior to the commencement date of the period of

reinsurance, and that lines written "to stand" may not be varied without the

documented agreement of those Reinsurers.

The signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be

varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of Reinsurance, by the

documented agreement of the Reinsured and all Reinsurers whose lines are to be

varied. The variation to the contracts will take effect only when all such

Reinsurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing

from the date set out in that agreement.

Following advice of the aforementioned signed participation, the Reinsurer

authorises the intermediary to insert the signed line as soon as it has been advised

to the Reinsurer to enable compliance with Reinsured Evidence of Cover

requirements.
