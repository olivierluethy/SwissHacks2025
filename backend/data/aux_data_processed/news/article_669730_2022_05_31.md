Premium growth during the first quarter saw an average increase of 11%, which was supported by continued favorable pricing for commercial insurance lines and reinsurance business, according to a report from Gallagher Re.
Underwriting results were strong with re/insurers posting a 94% combined ratio, compared with 96% during Q1 2021, said the report titled “Global (re)insurers’ Q1 2022 financial results.” (A combined ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit).
Nearly every company posted a sub-100% combined ratio, driven by favorable rate increases, net favorable development of prior accident year reserves, and lower natural catastrophe losses compared to the first quarter last year (when winter storm Uri hit Texas), Gallagher Re indicated.
“Increases in economic inflation, and an expectation that this trend will continue, have created more uncertainty around ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims,” the report continued. “These factors, as well as the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on net investment income, have driven the higher rates. Companies are achieving rate on rate increases in many cases for the fourth consecutive year.”
Gallagher Re noted that some management teams are carefully monitoring trends in pricing and claims inflation and will adjust premium growth where required to support profitability.
