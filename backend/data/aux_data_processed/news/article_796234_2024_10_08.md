Russia targeted a ship loaded with Ukrainian grain with a ballistic missile Monday — the second in two days — killing one person and injuring five, according to the Infrastructure Ministry in Kyiv.
The Optima, which sails under the flag of Palau, was damaged in an Odesa region port shortly after it docked for loading, Infrastructure Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said in a statement without elaborating on the size of its cargo or exact location.
“This is a purposeful practice of intimidation and obstruction of the work of the Ukrainian maritime corridor,” Kuleba said.
Another bulker loaded with Ukrainian grain for export was damaged Sunday during a Russian missile barrage in the Odesa region. The Paresa, sailing under the flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was struck near one of docks at the Black Sea port of Pivdennyi. The ship had 6,000 tons of corn on board. Its crew remained unharmed.

Russia frequently targets Ukrainian grain export infrastructure on the Black Sea and on the Danube, a key source of revenue for the country. While Kyiv’s export volumes have remained resilient, the attacks have pushed traders to use more expensive alternative routes.
The ministry published pictures showing broken glass in the wheelhouse and metal debris near loaded grain after the attack against Paresa. Greece-based AK shipping, the owner of the ship, confirmed the vessel had come under Russian attack. It had sailed into the port with empty holds with the purpose of loading grain, the firm said in an emailed statement.

As of Monday afternoon, Pivdennyi port operated as normal, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Navy, said.
Last month, a Russian missile hit an Egypt-bound grain ship in neutral waters just outside Ukraine.
