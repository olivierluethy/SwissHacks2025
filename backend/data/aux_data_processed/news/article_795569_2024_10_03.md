While the Lloyd’s market reported its best first-half profit in 17 years, it isn’t resting on its laurels. It is carefully monitoring areas where potential vulnerabilities have been identified.
During a recent market briefing, Rachel Turk, Lloyd’s chief underwriting officer, Lloyd’s, focused on five key areas that occupy her time and attention: property, cyber, US general liability, the legacy market, and, last but certainly not least, the issue of delegated authority arrangements, which she highlighted as a major concern.
Delegated authority business is an area of concern that “seeks to chip away at my overall positivity [about the market’s performance],” Turk said during the Q3 market briefing on Sept. 20. (Lloyd’s reported an H1 profit of £4.9 billion with a combined ratio of 83.7 on Sept. 5).
The poor performance of the delegated book was one of the contributors to Lloyd’s deteriorating loss ratio from 2013 onwards. “We must not make the same mistakes again,” said Rachel Turk, Lloyd’s CUO.
