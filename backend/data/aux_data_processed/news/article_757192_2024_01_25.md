Amazon has pulled the plug on its UK home insurance venture – a comparison website – after launching in October 2022.
“Over the last year, we have been evaluating various businesses and programs, and as a part of that we’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue the Amazon Insurance Store,” according to Vassil Gedov, head of the Amazon Insurance Store, in an emailed statement.
“Customers who have purchased policies will not see any changes to their coverage, claims in process at this time, or future claims they may make during their policy term. We will provide guidance to customers on any actions they need to take as a result of this change.”
Amazon.com Inc. had partnered with three insurers: Ageas UK, Co-op, and LV= General Insurance, a unit of German insurer Allianz.
The intent of the plan was for the portal to provide third-party services initially and expand the number of insurers on the site.
A company representative said the latest news only affects the Amazon Insurances Store in the UK
