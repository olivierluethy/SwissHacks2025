Global commercial insurance prices rose 11% in the first quarter of 2022, marking the fifth consecutive reduction in rate increases since pricing peaked at 22% in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the Global Insurance Market Index published by insurance broker Marsh.
The first quarter of 2022 was the 18th consecutive quarter that global composite prices rose, which continued the longest run of increases since the inception of the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index in 2012. However, the rate of increase continues to moderate across most lines of business and in almost all geographies, said the Marsh report.
“Valuation has become a focal point at virtually every renewal for all insurers, particularly related to concerns about the current inflationary environment, supply chain challenges, and labor shortages. Loss experience where adjusted loss amounts were well above the reported values has further heightened insurers’ focus on this issue.”
