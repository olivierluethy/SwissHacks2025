Global commercial insurance rates increased by 1% on average in the first quarter of 2024, compared with a 2% increase in Q4 2023, according to the Global Insurance Market Index published by Marsh, the insurance brokerage business of Marsh McLennan.
Rates continued to be relatively consistent, with most regions experiencing small decreases in Q1, said the report.
Marsh explained this was largely driven by a strengthening of the trend for decreases in financial and professional and cyber lines and increasing competition among insurers in the global property market.
On average, rates declined in the UK, Asia, Pacific, Canada and in India, Middle East & Africa regions by 2%, while rates increased in the US and Europe by 3%, and in Latin America and the Caribbean by 5%.
Other findings from the report include:
“A continued moderation in insurance rates, and an increased appetite among insurers particularly for well-managed risks, will be welcomed by clients that continue to face major global economic and geopolitical uncertainty,” commented Pat Donnelly, president, Marsh Specialty and Global Placement, Marsh, in a statement.
Marsh noted that all references to rate and rate movements in the report are averages, unless otherwise noted. For ease of reporting, Marsh said it rounded all percentages regarding rate movements to the nearest whole number.
