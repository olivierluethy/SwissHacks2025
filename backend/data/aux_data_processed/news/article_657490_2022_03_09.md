Britain said on Wednesday it had impounded a plane connected to a Russian billionaire under new aviation sanctions which give authorities the power to detain any Russian aircraft and to ban exports of aviation or space-related goods to Russia.
The measures to strengthen action against Russian aircraft mean it is a criminal offense for any to fly or land in the United Kingdom.
