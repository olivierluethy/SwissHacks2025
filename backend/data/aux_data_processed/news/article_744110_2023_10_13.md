Generali said on Thursday that it has reached an agreement with German insurance heavyweight Allianz for the sale of TUA Assicurazioni for 280 million euros ($295 million) in cash.
Mediobanca, Banca di Credito Finanziario and Rothschild & Co acted as financial advisers for the deal, the company said.
TUA offers policies covering areas such as motoring, home and health and was acquired by Generali as part of its deal to buy smaller rival Cattolica two years ago.
