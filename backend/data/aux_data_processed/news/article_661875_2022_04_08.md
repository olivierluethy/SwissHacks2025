Greensill Capital collapsed more than a year ago, but $9.3 billion of assets sold to investors as notes are yet to pay out.
The lender, which collapsed in March 2021, sold short-term trade finance products to investors including funds run by Credit Suisse Group AG and GAM Holding AG. The investments were described as short-term products in fund documentation, rarely lasting any longer than 12 months.
