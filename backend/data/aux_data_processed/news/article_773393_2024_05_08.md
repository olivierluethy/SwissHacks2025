International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. announced it will begin trading for the first time at Lloyd’s on May 9, 2024, demonstrating the company’s long-term commitment to the London market.
Located in the Lloyd’s underwriting room at One Lime Street, IGI will be located in Box 330A, Gallery 3. IGI will trade across multiple business lines, with underwriting teams operating on a rotational basis.
The establishment of a presence within the Lloyd’s room contributes to IGI’s strategic growth objectives by increasing distribution and enhancing brand recognition, the company said.
“This is an exciting move for IGI at a time when strategic and profitable growth is a priority for us. Having a company box in Lloyd’s underwriting room, in the heart of the London insurance marketplace, strengthens IGI’s profile and provides enhanced distribution capabilities in the most efficient manner,” commented Christopher Jarvis, group chief underwriting officer at IGI.
Established in 2001, IGI is a Bermuda domiciled re/insurer that underwrites a diverse portfolio of specialty lines. In addition to Bermuda, the company operates in London, Malta, Dubai, Amman, Oslo, Kuala Lumpur, and Casablanca.
