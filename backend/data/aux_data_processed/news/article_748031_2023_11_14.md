Insurance broker WTW announced the launch of “A-Star,” an excess layer D&O insurance solution for directors and officers. The new facility provides access to up to £/$/€ 80,000,000 additional capacity for directors & officers liability insurance, ensuring comprehensive protection for non-indemnified loss scenarios.
A-Star provides a vital protective layer above primary D&O insurance, said WTW, explaining that the product provides directors, officers, and insured individuals with peace of mind in the face of uncertainties. A-Star safeguards against liabilities not indemnified by their companies, be it due to legal restrictions, insolvency, or denial of indemnification.
“A-Star’s unique structure harnesses the benefits of both Lloyd’s and Company market capacity, offering dynamic solutions tailored to our clients’ needs,” commented Marcus Porter-Wight, head of GB FINEX, WTW.
“It provides our clients with dedicated coverage that shields their directors and officers from uncertainties. This innovative solution is a direct response to our clients’ evolving needs, reflecting our unwavering commitment to their success in a dynamic business landscape,” Porter-Wight added.
