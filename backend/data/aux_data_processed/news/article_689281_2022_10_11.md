The Jensten Group, the UK-headquartered independent insurance broking group. has completed the acquisition of Ravenhall Risk Solutions, following final regulatory approval, bringing an additional 2,500 clients and 25 staff to the group.
Leeds-based Ravenhall Risk Solution serves commercial and personal clients including solutions for traditionally harder to place risks such as unmanned aerial vehicle operators and the equestrian industry.
Financial details of the deal, which was first announced in July 2022, were not disclosed.
“Ravenhall has a long-standing and established reputation for service and I am delighted that they have now formally joined the Jensten family. The management team and staff all share our core values and culture, focused on providing exceptional broking service and putting clients first, making us an ideal fit,” commented Alistair Hardie, Jensten Group CEO, in a statement.
“We are seeing more and more community brokers approaching us to help secure their future as independent brokers focused on delivering for their customers,” he added. “They are also keen to seek support as they look to wrestle with increasingly complex compliance and administrative demands.”
