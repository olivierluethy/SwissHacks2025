Mosaic Insurance is opening an office in Toronto, Ontario and has hired Ian Fraser to spearhead the company’s expansion into the Canadian specialty insurance market.
Fraser joins as president of Mosaic Insurance Services Canada Inc., responsible for operational strategy and growth, with core business lines comprising professional liability, cyber, financial institutions, and transactional liability.
“This is part of our ongoing strategy to build out broader geographical market access for our product,.” said Mosaic’s Underwriting Director David White.
With more than 20 years’ experience in the specialty sphere, Fraser has led commercial portfolios for global and Canadian domestic insurance carriers. He previously was head of cyber/technology and professional lines for Sovereign Insurance in Toronto. Prior to Sovereign, he worked at RSA Canada for more than six years. His focus has included developing product, pricing, governance, distribution, and portfolio management.
Backed by private-equity firm Golden Gate Capital, Mosaic launched as a global specialty insurer in February 2021. Comprising Lloyd’s Syndicate 1609 and agencies worldwide, the company has six specialty lines of business: cybersecurity, political risk, political violence, transactional liability, financial institutions, and professional liability.
Toronto will be Mosaic’s fifth global office, following those in Bermuda, London, New York, and Chicago.
