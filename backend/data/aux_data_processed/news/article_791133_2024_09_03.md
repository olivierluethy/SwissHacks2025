Insured losses have surged in the past decade as climate change in Canada sparks wildfires, intense hailstorms and thunderstorms with severe flooding in major cities.
Insured losses from natural disasters averaged C$2.2 billion ($1.63 billion) a year over the last decade, far exceeding the previous decade’s average of C$632 million ($468.3 million), according to the IBC, which expects escalating losses to continue.
The wildfire in Canadian tourist destination Jasper this year surpassed C$880 million ($652.1 million) in insured damages, according to initial estimates, IBC said last week.
