PoloWorks announced the launch of Polo Insurance Managers (PIM) after the Guernsey Financial Services Commission granted “approval in principle.”
PIM will be one of the few independent insurance managers active in Europe and will serve captive, commercial and ILS clients using best in class technology, data insights and superior client service. Initially based in Guernsey, a leading captive insurance domicile in Europe, PIM’s core executive team will be supported by Polo Commercial Insurance Services which employs 350 UK-based insurance specialists.
“We see a tremendous opportunity as a truly independent insurance manager to offer our existing and future clients with a comprehensive and bespoke insurance management service,” commented Mark Elliott, who has been announced as chief executive officer of PIM.
“As part of the PoloWorks business, PIM will be able to leverage substantial in-group expertise and modern technology to offer a market beating insurance manager proposition,” according to Paul Andrews, chief executive officer, PoloWorks.
