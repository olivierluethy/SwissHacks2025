Major aircraft lessor Avolon recorded a first-quarter impairment of $304 million to cover the full financial impact of having 10 jets still stuck in Russia following European Union sanctions that forced the termination of all Russian leases.
Irelandâ€™s Avolon said on Tuesday it cut the carrying value of the jets to zero having repossessed four aircraft to date. It also struck an optimistic tone on the outlook for the sector as air travel largely resumed after a series of COVID-19 lockdowns.
