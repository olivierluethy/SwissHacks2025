AM Best’s population of global reinsurance companies posted a return on equity (ROE) of 22% in 2023 – a five-year high that was driven mainly by favorable investment income and strong underwriting performance. The fundamentals are excellent, but Hurricanes Helene and Milton “will probably stall any softening of the market cycle,” AM Best said.
Net investment income in 2023 led the contribution to surplus growth, followed closely by underwriting gains and unrealized capital gains – all components that pushed ROEs well above the cost of equity capital, said AM Best in an analysis of reinsurers in its Top 25 Global Reinsurance Composite.
“In 2023, a year in which premium rates continued to move up, interest rates remained high, and capital markets performed well, the composite recorded its highest ROE in five years,” said the composite report titled “Significant Increase in Global Reinsurers’ ROE Due to Investment and Underwriting Results.”
‘Fourth-quarter 2024 results will be negatively affected, but full-year earnings should still be favorable. Further reinsurance market hardening is unlikely, but Helene and Milton will probably stall any softening of the market cycle.’
