The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday sued Brazilian miner Vale for allegedly making false and misleading disclosures about the safety of its dams ahead of a 2019 disaster that killed 270 people.
Beginning in 2016, Vale manipulated dam safety audits, obtained fraudulent stability certificates and misled local governments, communities and investors with its environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures, the SEC alleged in a statement and court filing.
