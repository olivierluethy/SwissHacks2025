Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, the second largest shareholder in Assicurazioni Generali, has quit its board, the Italian insurer said on Friday, opening a new chapter in a long-standing shareholder row.
Caltagirone holds a 9.95% stake in Generali, having beefed up his holding in recent years as tensions mounted between the construction and newspaper magnate on the one hand, and the insurer’s board and its single biggest investor Mediobanca on the other.
Shares in Generali fell more than 2% after the news, underperforming a flat Italian blue-chip index .FTMIB on investor concerns that Caltagirone might reduce his stake.
