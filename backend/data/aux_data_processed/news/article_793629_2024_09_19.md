Japanese radio equipment maker Icom Inc. said on Thursday that it was investigating the facts regarding news reports that two-way radio devices bearing its logo have exploded in Lebanon.
Hand-held radios used by armed group Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon’s south, after similar explosions of the group’s pagers the day before. Images of the exploded walkie-talkies showed labels with “ICOM” and “made in Japan.”
Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Icom said in a statement that it would release updated information on the matter as it becomes available on its website.
