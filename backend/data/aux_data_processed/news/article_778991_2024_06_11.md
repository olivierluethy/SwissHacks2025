The Fortegra Group Inc., the Jacksonville, Florida-based specialty insurer and subsidiary of Tiptree Inc., announced it has received approval to operate in Belgium and the European Union.
Fortegra Belgium Insurance Co. NV will be based in Brussels and will underwrite specialty lines of business. Fortegra Europe Insurance Co., Fortegra’s Malta company, will continue its focus on warranty products. (With a headquarters in Brussels, Fortegra Belgium Insurance is able to operate throughout the EU’s 27 states).
Fortegra’s Belgium operations offer the company access to strategic distribution channels in a continually evolving market.
Fortegra said it will now be able to collaborate with European managing general agents (MGAs) that are experts in their chosen products and sectors, providing these MGAs with flexible deal structures, partnership transparency, and shared risk.
“The MGA space across Europe is vibrant and compelling and provides a tremendous growth opportunity,” said Rick Kahlbaugh, president and chief executive officer at Fortegra, in a statement. “We are thrilled to receive this license, which will allow us to provide innovative solutions to partners across Europe.”
