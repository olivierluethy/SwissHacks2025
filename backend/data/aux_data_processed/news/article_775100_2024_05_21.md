Shares of Japanese insurers MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc. and Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. surged after the companies announced stock buybacks, as well as plans to sell their holdings in client companies.
MS&AD, which also reported full-year guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations, soared by a record 18% at one point in Tokyo. Tokio Marine surged 8.7%, while a measure of insurance companies on the Topix index climbed as much as 6.1% to lead the broader gauge higher.
“Measures including sale of so-called strategic holdings are being received favorably by investors” as a form of shareholder return and improving capital efficiency, said Tetsuo Seshimo, a portfolio manager at Saison Asset Management Co.
