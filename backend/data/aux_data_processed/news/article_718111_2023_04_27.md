To get fire department approval for their six-story London office project made of strong engineered wood known as mass timber, Theo Michell and Richard Walker had to build a full-scale section of it in the UK, ship it to Poland and attempt to set it on fire.
The mockup was set alight “with enough material that replicates the fire load that you get from furniture and carpets and desks, and all the rest of it, and you see how that structure performs,” says Michell.
“It was cool,” adds Walker. “It looked amazing.”
Their building, called Paradise, passed the fire test and is under construction, though not without a significant drag on their budget and time.
“There’s been a real breakdown of trust between the insurance industry and the building industry post-Grenfell, that we are now five years on in the process of rebuilding” — Dominic Lion with Gallagher.
