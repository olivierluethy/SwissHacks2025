Miller, the London-based independent specialist re/insurance broker, announced the launch of its online Private Clients platform, providing digital solutions for clients in the high-net-worth space.
The online system is the first broker offering of its type in the market and will initially focus on buildings and contents insurance, Miller explained in a statement. This launch provides a foundation for further rollout, with plans to offer additional products on the platform throughout the year.
Developed by Miller’s Private Client experts in close collaboration with the in-house innovation team, the platform provides clients with the efficiency and speed of online delivery, with clients able to access cover within minutes of entering their requirements. The technology is supported by Miller’s specialist team to ensure that the ease of online delivery is matched by the bespoke expertise and advice needed around more complex requirements.
“As a key growth area for Miller, the launch of our online portal in the private client market is a significant milestone. We have seen that clients are increasingly looking for the quickest and most efficient ways of securing coverage, and the combination of our new automated proposition alongside our team’s many years of expertise in the sector will provide us with a critical competitive edge and differentiator,” commented Katie Small, head of Private Clients.
“This rollout is just the beginning, with further products set to be included on the platform later this year to ensure we continue to provide comprehensive and market-leading services to our clients.”
