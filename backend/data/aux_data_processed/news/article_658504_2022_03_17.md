Thailand’s insurance regulator ordered Southeast Insurance Pcl and Thai Insurance Pcl to stop taking new clients and sell some assets after their capital fell below the legally required levels.
The non-life units of Thai Group Holdings must boost their balance sheets to meet capital requirements within 30 days, the Office of Insurance Commission said in a statement on Thursday. Value of each firm’s assets has fallen below their liabilities, while cash and other liquid assets are insufficient to pay compensation claims by customers, the regulator said.
