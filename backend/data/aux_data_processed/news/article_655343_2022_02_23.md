The operator of Felicity Ace, the ship transporting thousands of Porsches, Lamborghinis and other Volkswagen AG vehicles, said Tuesday it assumes the car carrier is still on fire almost a full week after the crew abandoned ship.
Two large tugboats are spraying the vessel, a unit of Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. said on a website set up to provide updates on the incident. They will assist with controlling the position of the ship before an initial salvage team already on site inspects the carrier.
