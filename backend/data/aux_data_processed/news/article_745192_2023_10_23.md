AXA XL Risk Consulting announced the launch of AXA Immersive Solutions, an innovative training solution leveraging virtual reality (VR) and digital twin technologies.
AXA Immersive Solutions gives AXA XL’s risk consultants access to a 3D model of a standard factory to provide engaging and sophisticated training for risk managers, facilities/plant managers and site operators, through the use of VR experiences. A model of a client’s site can be developed to provide more realistic training and better address their specific risk prevention needs.
“Our clients are increasingly using digital twin capabilities to model their production sites, processes and supply chains to drive productivity and improve safety,” commented Jonathan Salter, global head of AXA XL Risk Consulting.
“With AXA Immersive Solutions, we are leveraging the same technology to create risk and insurance services that have the potential to be far more efficient than traditional solutions, especially when combined with the expertise of our experienced risk consultants,” Salter said.
“The development of VR-enabled training solutions for our risk consultants and clients is just one exciting area of innovation that demonstrates our ability to provide disruptive yet simple solutions to complex problems, all while speaking the same language as our most future-focused customers,” Dan Bendavid, global innovation lead at AXA XL, said.
AXA Immersive Solutions has been developed in collaboration with AXA Digital Commercial Platform and incubated within AXA Next, an AXA Group innovation unit.
