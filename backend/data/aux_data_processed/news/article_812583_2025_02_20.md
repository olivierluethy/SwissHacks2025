Delta Air Lines Inc. is offering $30,000 to every passenger aboard a regional jet flight that came to rest upside down after crash landing at a Toronto airport earlier this week.
The payments are “a good-faith gesture” that have “no strings attached and does not affect rights,” Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesman, said Wednesday. Carriers in the past have made similar payments, such as $5,000 to help passengers replace possessions lost on US Airways’ “Miracle on the Hudson” flight in 2009.
There were no fatalities among the 76 passengers and four crew members in the accident Monday at Toronto-Pearson International Airport, although 21 people were injured. Canadian aviation safety officials have recovered the cockpit voice and data recorders from the Bombardier CRJ900 plane and are trying to determine a cause.
