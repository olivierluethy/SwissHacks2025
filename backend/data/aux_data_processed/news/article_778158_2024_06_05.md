Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., the Rolling Meadows, Illinois-based broker, announced that its specialist underwriting subsidiary Pen Underwriting has acquired Ireland’s Wrightway Underwriting Ltd.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Based in Wexford, Ireland, Wrightway is a managing general agent (MGA) that provides motor and liability coverages for the haulage and fleet sector across Ireland through its independent broker clients, as well as other commercial and personal insurance products.
The business will become part of Pen Underwriting, and David Crean will continue to lead the team from its current location alongside Linda Roberts and Mary Lyons.
“Wrightway brings a reputation for client excellence, complements Pen’s existing specialist capabilities and provides further growth opportunities for our Ireland operations,” said J. Patrick Gallagher Jr., chairman and CEO. “I am delighted to welcome David, Linda, Mary and their colleagues to our growing, global team.”
